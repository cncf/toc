# CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)

The CNCF TOC is the technical governing body of the CNCF Foundation. It admits and oversees all projects in the CNCF Foundation and has a mandate to facilitate driving neutral consensus for:
* defining and maintaining the technical vision for the Cloud Native Computing Foundation,
* approving new projects within the scope for CNCF set by the Governing Board (GB), and create a conceptual architecture for the projects, aligning projects, removing or archiving projects,
* accepting feedback from end user committee and map to projects,
* aligning interfaces to components under management (code reference implementations before standardizing), and defining common practices to be implemented across CNCF projects, if any.

## Projects

See the [current CNCF projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) and a description of project maturity levels (Sandbox, Incubating, Graduated).

The CNCF provides [list of services](https://www.cncf.io/services-for-projects/) for incubating and graduated projects hosted in the foundation. A subset of these services is also available for [Sandbox](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/) level projects.

Do you want to contribute to a project? We have [outlined the process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/README.md) to get started. If you have any questions or don't know where to start, please open an [issue](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues).
