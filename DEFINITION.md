# CNCF Cloud Native Definition v1.0 #

*Approved by TOC: 6/11/2018*

Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic
environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable
infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with
robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal
toil.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an
ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these
innovations accessible for everyone.
