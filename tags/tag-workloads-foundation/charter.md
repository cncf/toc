# CNCF TAG Workloads Foundation

## Mission

To define and advance practices and standards for fundamental cloud native workload execution environments and their related lifecycle management within cloud native systems, applications, and architectures. This supports the CNCF's technical vision by addressing critical problems faced by adopters and contributing to a robust cloud native ecosystem.

## Scope

This TAG covers the following sub-domains and topics within its scope:
- Containers
- OS
- Runtime
- Virtual Machines
- Serverless
- Web Assembly
- Batch
- Serving
- Scheduler
- Orchestrator
- Deployment
- Dynamic Scaling
- CI/CD

## Out of Scope

- Anything not explicitly mentioned in the scope above is out of scope.
- This TAG will collaborate with other TAGs on overlapping areas, but will not focus on topics explicitly owned by other TAGs and initiatives.
- This TAG will not cover technologies that are not cloud-native (defined in [CNCF Cloud Native definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md))

## Anticipated Deliverables

Expected outputs of the TAG Workloads Foundation may include:

- Subprojects that represent ongoing services or programs requiring stewardship.
- Initiatives submitted to the TOC that are lightweight, time-bound, and objective-focused units of work. Examples include “Batch system Best Practices White Paper” and “GitOps Best Practices White Paper”.
- Other outputs consistent with advancing the TAG's scope, which may include frameworks, guidelines, or whitepapers.

These deliverables are intended to provide services to projects, other TAGs, or the TOC.

## Success Criteria

Success is based on the effective establishment and operation of Subprojects and Initiatives for the TAG, the creation and dissemination of valuable resources such as best practices and assessments, and the TAG's ability to maintain focus on its defined scope and align with TOC requirements. Success will also involve recruiting new leadership and community members into the TAG to support, drive, and establish deliverables within the TAG’s scope.

TAGs are expected to make incremental progress in identifying and addressing knowledge and technology gaps within the cloud native ecosystem that support projects in driving consistent outcomes for adopters across technologies, best practices, specifications, frameworks, and capabilities in cloud native.

## Coordination

The TAG Workloads Foundation will coordinate with various stakeholders within the CNCF ecosystem:

- CNCF Projects: The TAG provides services to projects and its work helps align projects within the CNCF ecosystem.This coordination ensures alignment across the foundation and provides pathways for community focuses to be supported
- Other TAGs: Coordination is essential as TAGs serve needs across projects and other TAGs. 
- TOC Subprojects: TAG leadership participates in TOC Subprojects like Project Reviews and Contributor Strategy.
- Community Groups: Community Groups are encouraged to discuss initiative ideas and may submit applications for initiatives within a TAG.

## Alignment with the CNCF TOC Charter

The TAG Workloads Foundation charter is directly aligned with the CNCF TOC charter. The TOC is the technical governing body responsible for maintaining the technical vision and driving common practices across projects. The TOC's vision is problem-centric, encouraging projects to solve challenges faced by adopters. By focusing on foundational workload types (Containers, VMs, Serverless, Wasm) and key related aspects (Runtime, OS, Scheduling, Orchestration, CI/CD, Deployment), the TAG Workloads Foundation directly addresses significant problems faced by cloud native adopters in executing and managing their applications. The TAG's work in defining best practices and frameworks (as shown in example initiatives) contributes to driving common practices and aligning projects within the ecosystem, as mandated by the TOC.  The TAG's work in defining best practices, frameworks, and performing assessments contributes to driving common practices and aligning projects within the ecosystem, as mandated by the TOC.
