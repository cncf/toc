# Cloud Native Technical Papers process

This guide serves to provide technical groups in CNCF a consistent process and mechanism to create, collaborate, and publish technical content in the form of whitepapers that increase the technical accuracy and potency of content provided. It promotes visibility of these activites, fair and opportune community feedback, and rigor in technical review.

This Paper process has been adopted from [CNCF's TAG Security Paper Process](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/publications/paper-process.md) and modified to cover TAGs and WGs under the oversight of the TOC. It is intended to complement existing TAG governance.

## Purpose of Technical Papers in cloud native

Technical papers, commonly referred to as whitepapers, provide the target audience with technical understanding on a given topic. Within the CNCF, technical papers serve one of two primary purposes:
* **Guiding the ecosystem in understanding and reasoning around a technology or technical domain area and any best practices associated with it.** Papers that serve as ecosystem guides inform cloud native projects and community members on a particular topic or series of related topics. The audience for these papers is usually other technologists and engineers that are actively involved in projects so they may incorporate recommendations, concepts, and guidance into their projects. These may be future leaning, where the ecosystem currently lacks the technology or where the concepts are still emerging and projects may benefit from insights and guidance curated by domain experts.
* **To inform adopters about a particular technology, technical domain, or concept and how cloud native can address a desired use case.** Papers that provide adopters of cloud native projects and the broader industry with a more indepth understanding of a particular technology component such as APIs, technical concepts like sustainability footprints, and sub-domain topics like software supply chain security. These papers may establish decision or technology frameworks that allow adopters to reason about cloud native and open source projects to achieve a particular use case and will convey best practices for their use and integration.

Papers are intended to serve as *static* sources of information that can frequently be referred back to. When scoped and developed correctly, papers may only need refreshed or updated once a year or as new understandings of the topic emerge. If a particular topic area or technology is rapidly changing, and lacks industry consensus, a paper is not recommended and interested individuals should consider a presentation or blog post on the topic that reflects the pace of change and opportunities for clarity and alignment.

## Initiating a Paper

In order to ensure consistency in development, review, and publication, TAGs and WGs that wish to produce technical papers will follow this process, adapting their groups' particular governance to the necessary areas defined.

### Defining a need

For any individual or group interested in developing a technical paper, there must be a defined need or observable opportunity to close a knowledge gap. When proposing a technical paper, an initial scope must be established to facilitate discussion and interest within the TAG via an Issue. It is expected that the Issue title and content will be adjusted and modified as the TAG and group refine the scope.

### Presenting the paper idea to the TAG

The paper scope and topic should be raised in at least one TAG meeting to solicit volunteers (minimally 4). TAG leadership reserves the right to hold off on moving forward with a paper due to existing TAG commitments, lack of volunteers, or lack of consensus on need or disparities in scope. 

### TAG leader sponsorship and cross-TAG awareness

A TAG leader (co-chair or tech lead) must step forward to sponsor the paper. Other TAG leaders may serve as the lead for paper development but the role of sponsor must be independent from the lead for the paper to reduce any bias in the process. The paper's sponsor is responsible for ensuring the development of the paper adheres to this process, is still progressing towards publication, and provides the initial review of the draft before public comment period may open.

The paper sponsor is also expected to coordinate awareness of the paper development and timelines to other TAGs to ensure they are appropriately included and have the opportunity to contribute and participate.

### Refining the scope, audience and participants

Interest in participating is expressed on the Issue by comments of those individuals. Soliciting interest and participation must allow for sufficient time (no less than two weeks) for fair opportunity to gather interest. Interested parties should then meet to define timelines, refine the scope, declare the audience, and determine paper lead. It is recommended that TAGs leverage communication channels to increase awareness of the proposed paper, its topic, and to solict potential contributors. If substantial interest has not been gained within one month, it is recommended the proposed paper be closed due to lack of interest - this does not prevent the group from pursuing it in the future.

## Managing paper development

Once the group has met to define timelines, scope, audience, and determined the lead, the Issue must be updated to provide the following information (initial estimates provided but may be adjusted by the group or TAG leadership as appropriate):

| Milestone | Estimated Time |
| --- | --- |
| Audience, Goals, & refining scope | 1 week |
| Outline | 2 weeks |
| Tasking Assignment | 1 week |
| Content Rough-in | 2-3 weeks |
| Collaborative Review | 2 weeks |
| Executive Summary and content wrap up | 2 weeks |
| Narrative Voice | 1-2 weeks |
| Final Group Review | 1 week |
| Community Review | 2 weeks |
| Public comment adjudication | 2 weeks (simultaneous with review) |
| Leadership Review | 1-2 weeks |
| CNCF publishing engagement | ~2-3 weeks |
| Addition to the repo | 2 weeks |
| Blog post and publishing coordination | 2-3 weeks |

### Milestones Details

The milestones for developing a paper are designed to ensure planning, consideration, review are accounted for and addressed. They also allow contributors to apply this framework to producing a paper efficiently, by establishing varies feedback loops to continue enhancing and tightenting up the content.

Each milestone provides an important value-add to the content of final paper:
* Audience, Goals, and Refining Scope - these set the boundaries, depth, and desired outcome of the paper. These are referred to by later milestones to keep alignment with the intent behind the work.
* Outline - Starting with an outline allows for the group to get a general idea of all the areas that _currently_ know need to be included. Later milestones may adjust the content included or excluded, but the outline serves as a starting point.
* Tasking Assignment - Allows contributors to the paper to own portions of the content, and allows reviewers to identify an individual to assist in clarifying content and ideas.
* Content Rough-in - Allows for the assigned contributor(s) to begin writing ideas and thoughts for the area. It provides flexibility in that the content doesnt need to be a complete thought, but more as a thought and idea that is capable for further refinement.
* Collaborative Review - Lets the group come back to look at the entirety of the draft content. This could reveal gaps, duplicative informations, or even restructure and move content for better flow without heavily investing in content refinement should a section be removed.
* Executive Summary and content wrap up - brings more polish the papers, transitioning from a concept into a full paper. The executive summary (if required) provides and overview of what is discussed.
* Narrative Voice - ensures consistency in the tone, flow, and attitude of the paper. It makes sure the paper doesn't appear written by 20 different voices, but rather one that is unified and representative of the body producing the work; a TAG or WG within the CNCF.
* Final Group Review - this is the last chance for the group to shore up the paper and address any areas of concern and comments before opening it to community review. When all preliminary milestones are complete, this step should permit the group to have an enjoyable read without interruption from questions or unclear topics.
* Community Review - this allows the community's perspective to be documented on the written work. Factoring in additional considerations and views not represented by the contributors, so that all aspects can be reasonably included (provided they align with the scope, goals, and audience defined previously). It provides a place of discussion and information that may result in minor changes to the material.
* Public comment adjudication - this allows the contributors to consider and weigh comments for incorporation or exclusion in the paper. It also supports later milestones for long term maintenance of the paper by understanding what kinds of questions are being asked so they can be addressed holistically.
* Leadership review - essential and critical to ensuring the technical accuracy and quality of the material content in the paper. It also functions as a final check before publication to catch any potential issues that may have been missed.
* Publishing engagement - initiates a formal, static artifact of the paper for linking and reference in a format consumable by the audience beyond git.
* Addition to the repo - provides a markdown manageable artifacta and metadata for discovery, updates, and longevity of the material.
* Blog post and publishing coordination - these functions increase awareness of the paper, in particular the blog post provides some context around why the paper is warranted and how the audience could leverage the paper for their architectures and organizations.

#### Audience, Goals, and Refining Scope

Define the following:

- Who is the intended audience?
- What positions do they hold?
- What problem are we addressing?
- What assumptions are we making about the audience or content?
- Document these in the "Introduction > Assumptions" section.

#### Outline

The outline needs to be crafted and placed in a shared document (google docs, hackmd, or other collaborative documentation tool). It will serve as the basis for paper structure and tasking. The Issue must be updated to link to the shared document.

#### Tasking Assignment

Contributors should assign themselves to various outline areas. This allows focus and identifies gaps needing more contributors. Use tools like Google Docs' "assign to me" feature for task assignment. Alternatively, participants may tag themselves in line by typing their name, or other agreed upon option to clarify who is responsible for which portions of the paper.

#### Content Rough-in

Assignees provide rough content through phrases, paragraphs, or bullets. If the assignee has drafted complete content (full sentences, ideas, well-expressed) they should indicate the content as "draft". This informs other collaborators that less effort may be needed to further develop the content and may facillitate comments to refine the material further or restructure as content is further developed.

#### Collaborative Review

Contributors refine raw content into drafts, comment on sections, expand ideas, and provide citations. It is recommended contributors use the corresponding Slack channel for larger thematic discussions. Groups may wish to establish a separate channel for technical paper discussions, but are not required to. The Issue should provide the link for the primary commnication channel should anyone have questions.

#### Executive Summary and Content Wrap-up

Adjudicators may choose to resolve community comments and suggestions as they are applied or may wait for the full comment period to close before adjudicating. Comments resulting in larger discussions should be decisively resolved and their resolution documented clearly, particularly if the comment concerns will not be included in the final paper. Adjudicators should make reasonable effort to ensure the comments and concerns raised are duly considered and incorporated, as appropriate.

#### Narrative Voice

Assign no more than three individuals for this task to ensure a unified voice. Ensure consistent language, phrasing, acronym use, footnotes, and citations. The final result of this unification should ensure the paper reads consistently, like it was written by a single entity. This also functions as the final edit before group review.

Individuals performing narrative voice may come from the contributors, or may be the TAG sponsor, or another individual. The important item to consider is that in the course of performing narrative voice, you must be mindful of the content's intent  that you may be modifying, having the context for what the topic is, why it is present, and what it is hoping to achieve is beneficial. Its important to also note that individuals in this role may perform actions on the content (deleting sections for instance) that may negatively affect a contributor, therefore anyone performing narrative voice should be considered trustworthy with good rapport in the group and with a penchant for providing justification and consideration. It is not ideal to have comments or content removed without reason, and providing reasoning is part of the narrative voice (and adjudication) process.

#### Final Group Review

The group collectively reviews the polished paper before opening it for community review. This is the last cursory check before opening to public content. It is imperative that contributors verify all referencable items are linked, cited, concepts explained, acronyms spelled out, and any unclear content is corrected. If the group fails to gain consensus on any of the content presented they may choose to remove it or explain the different perspectives that allow the reader to draw their own conclusions, this is paritcularly important where a technical recommendation results in security or performance trade offs.

The group should assign individuals to serve as comment adjudicators for public review at this point. These individuals will be responsible for validating commentary against the defined scope, assumptions, and audience.

#### Community Review

When ready for commmunity review, lock the paper from editing (except for Adjudicators). Make it public for comments and suggestions. Announce a two week public comment period via the TAG's mailing list as well as the TOC's mailing list. TAGs and groups may wish to leverage a git workflow for this, by moving the paper to markdown and filing a PR which would allow public comments on the PR.

This portion of the process is similar to a "peer review" and is essential to ensuring the validity and quality by the broader CNCF community. The TOC's public mailing list includes thousands of individuals across the ecosystem, to include current and former members of the TOC, TAGs, projects, and community members. The following sample text may be used to when sending out the message on the mailing list:

> Hello CNCF Community!
> The $GROUP has worked diligently in creating an initial draft paper on $TOPIC that provides the community with:
> * Recommendations for $THING, whether the organisation produces or consumes cloud native software.
> * Justifications and explanations for $THING
> We are asking you, the community, to review the paper and provide comments/suggestions/improvements by $DATETWOWEEKSOUT so that we may incorporate your comments and finalize the initial version.
> You may access the document at the below URL: $URL

#### Public Comment Adjudication

Adjudicators are may choose to resolve community comments and suggestions as they are applied or may wait for the full comment period to close before adjudicating. Comments resulting in larger discussions should be decisively resolved and their resolution documented clearly, particularly if the comment concerns will not be included in the final paper. Adjudicators should make reasonable effort to ensure the comments and concerns raised are duly considered and incorporated, as appropriate.

Adjudicators may be drawn from contributors to the paper, as they often have additional context that is assummed in the paper, but not declared until a commenter points it out. It is recommended that adjudicators be individuals most heavily involved in the operations of paper development, not necessarily tied to a specific topic or section (although perhaps they wrote many of them). They should be able to reason and apply the comment in the context of the section, as well as across the body of the paper, while still taking a step back to check assumptions in content.

#### Leadership Review and Approval

Once public comments are adjudicated, to ensure appropriate oversight on content, two additional reviews are required before the paper may be published.

##### TAG Sponsor and TOC Liaison review and approval

The TAG Sponsor must review and provide their approval on the finalized draft. Their review and approval signifies the paper as ready for the TOC Liaisons to review and approve.

The TAG Sponsor will work with the TAG Co-Chairs to ensure the TOC Liaisons are aware of their pending review and approval.

All approvals are to be reflected in the metadata heading of the document, the following example may be used:

**Version**: 2.0 **Created**: 12 Jan 2022 **Status**: WIP | In Review | **Approved**

**Last Reviewed**: 16 May 2022, **PDF Published**: 17 May 2022 **Release Version**: 2.0

**TAG Sponsor Approver** [X] $GITHUBHANDLE
**TOC Liaison Approvers** [X] $GITHUBHANDLE [X] $GITHUBHANDLE

**Version 2 (May 2022)**

* **Contributors**: $NAME or $GITHUBHANDLE
* **Reviewers**: $NAME or $GITHUBHANDLE

#### CNCF Publishing Engagement

In order to initiate publishing of the paper, a TAG co-chair must file a Service Desk ticket using the [CNCF Service Desk](https://cncfservicedesk.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/user/login?destination=portal%2F1). If a TAG co-chair does not have a service desk account, reach out to CNCF staff to have the account set up. In the service desk ticket, you'll need to let staff know what you're looking for, who is the primary (TAG Leadership sponsor) and secondary contact, and where the materials may be found for publication. 

The TAG Leadership sponsor works with CNCF for final edits, PDF conversion, and graphics inclusion. Review drafts before the final version is added to the repo to ensure accuracy and clarity. Note: papers do not need to be PDFs, however the markdown must be present in the TAG repo.

#### Addition to the Repo

The paper lead creates a README.md with:

- Title
- About: Brief summary
- Updates: Maintenance intentions; how the paper should be maintained, considerations for its scope, guidance on content, and unknown or opinionated content that was presented fairly and should be reviewed as changes occur
- Markdown: Maintained in markdown; how to maintain the paper in markdown, storing images, linking, headers, line wrap, etc.
- Contributing updates: Guidance for contributors; types of contributions appropriate to the paper, the background as to why it was created, who the audience is, topics that assist contributors not involved in original development of the paper but would be beneficial for determining appropriate updates
- Versioning and publishing: Criteria for updates (major versus minor versions), annual/bi-annual reviews, triggers like the finalization of specification/standard, etc.
- Original design decisions: Any big questions that came up during the development that provide more context around the paper and its contents, to include scoping
- Links to files in the repo

### Blog Publishing and Coordination

Coordinate with TAG leadership and CNCF for a blog post to increase visibility. Consider presenting at community events. Be sure to use TAG and TOC communication channels to increase awareness (TOC mailing list, TAG mailing list, TAG Slack channel, TAG Website, etc.).

## Authorship, Attribution, and Acknowledgements

Papers created by a CNCF TAG or WG are authored by the group, with contributors and reviewers acknowledged. Major contributors are highlighted in the "Acknowledgements" section. Each document should contain "Contributors," "Reviewers," and "Acknowledgements" sections as appropriate.

## Keeping the paper relevant

The cloud native ecosystem and its domains are still rapidly evolving and the best practices of yesterday may not be the right best practices for a new technology of tomorrow. It is therefore important that the paper be review periodically (annual or bi-annually) to ensure continued accuracy of the content through a version update. In some cases, the paper may need to be archived as the content has been rendered obsolete in light of a major ecosystem development. After the annual or bi-annual review is completed, a simple update to the markdown file to convey "last reviewed" date is sufficient if no changes were determined as necessary.

New papers on an existing paper topic are reasonable provided they can be referencable by the main paper and there is no pre-existing material on the subject. For example, a paper on software supply chain security may provide an initial architecture that later needs dedicated papers for development, build, distribution/storage, and deployment as more tooling is developed and as specifications emerge to solve issues the initial architecture didn't address. Where possible, link to existing material if content is already published and provide an enhancement, clarification, or caveats to such content in the context of the paper.
