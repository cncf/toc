# General Technical Review questions
v1.0
## Introduction

The General Technical Review questions can be completed by a project in lieu of a presentation to a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) as well as to satisfy the Engineering Principle requirements of a Sandbox application or Due Dillegence for moving levels. 

The questions are designed to prompt **_design thinking_** for projects that would like to one day be a graduated project.

The intent is to understand how the project has adopted and aligned with the CNCF maturation levels as well as encourage good design & security best practices. 


<!-- 
The General Technical Review questions can be completed by a project team in lieu of a presentation to a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) as well as to satisfy several of the Engineering Principle requirements for applying to CNCF Sandbox as well as applying to move to Incubation and Graduation.

For the purposes of the general technical review and further domain reviews, the questions are designed to prompt design thinking for ready-for-production projects and architecture. The intent is to understand and validate the cloud native software lifecycle of the project and whether it is in line with the CNCF Maturation process and levels. 

Project maintainers are expected to have designed the project for cloud native use cases and workloads, as well as taking a ‘secure by design and secure by default’ approach that enables adopters and consumers of the project the ability to ‘loosen’ the defaults in a manner that suits their environment, requirements and risk tolerance.

These questions are to gather knowledge about the project. Project maintainers are expected to answer to the best of their ability. **_Not every question will be addressable by every project._**

**Suggestion:** A recorded demo or diagram(s) may be easier to convey some of the concepts in the questions below. The project maintainers may provide a link to a recorded demo or add architectural diagrams along with your GTR questionnaire.

### General Technical Review questions 

The questions follow the cloud native software lifecycle day schemas:

**Day 0 - Planning Phase. (Sandbox)** - This phase covers design and architecture of the cloud native project.

**Day 1 - Installation and Deployment Phase (Incubation)** - This phase covers initial installation and deployment of the design developed during Day 0 - Planning Phase. 

**Day 2 - Day-to-Day Operations Phase (Graduated)** - This phase covers post-deployment operations in production-ready environments to include monitoring, maintenance, auditing and troubleshooting.


### How to use this template

Make a copy of the template below and answer questions related to your project level to the best of your ability.
_**Not every question will be addressable or relevant to every project.**_
If this is the case for your project, please mark it as not-applicable (N/A) and provide a brief explanation. 

**NOTE:** The questions are cumulative e.g. if you are applying for incubation or graduation, you should answer both day 0 and day 1 questions etc.

#### Tips

* Treat the GTR questionnaire as a living document and keep a copy of it in your project's own repo. The GTR questions are helpful to both contributors and users and will make updating it in the future less work when you want to apply to move levels.
* Answer more questions than the requirement for your level if it _makes sense for your project_. e.g. if you have documentaiton covering the different forms of observability in the Day-2 requirements.
* You **CAN** link out to your own project's documentation, but be sure to link to it in a _versioned_ form. e.g. link to it at a specific commit instead of the `main` branch, or versioned website.
* A recorded demo or diagram(s) may be easier to convey some of the concepts in the questions below. You may provide a link to a recorded demo or add architectural diagrams along with your GTR questionnaire.
* If you are unsure or have a question about any section below, **please ask**. Chances are you're not the only one with a question and the template should be updated with additional guidance.
