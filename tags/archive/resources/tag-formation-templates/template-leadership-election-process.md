The TAG leadership as well as the leadership of working groups or projects follows a common set of rules to ensure a transparent, open and accessible role transition between contributors.
Contributors in leadership positions provide guidance and directions to TAG members and ensure that the efforts are in line with its mission and values, as well as the goals of the TAG.
Roles within the TAG outlining expectations and responsibilities are defined in the [roles](template-roles.md) governance document. <!-- ! UPDATE THE LINK ! -->

## Process of nominations

Leadership roles are open to all interested participants within the community. Depending on the needs of the community, as determined by the current TAG leadership team (Chairs and TLs), nominations may come from working group co-chairs, TAG co-chairs and/or tech leads and/or other community members. Each leadership role is on a 2 year term once appointed.

Elections should be conducted by CNCF staff. TAG leadership Election should start 1-2 months after the TOC election finishes each year, pending CNCF staffâ€™s availability to run the elections.

For the immediate election in 2025, roughly 50% of the roles should be made available for election where existing leaders can choose to rerun, starting with the longest serving leaders. The rest of the leads who are not up for election should plan to be up for elections in 2026.

Co-chairs can be nominated by any existing co-chairs or TOC member. TL roles should be nominated by any existing co-chairs or TLs. WG leads can be nominated by any TAG leaders. TAGs may define their own process by which they field nominations for these roles, provided they adhere to CNCF and TOC expectations of openness, transparency, and accountability.

Co-chair elections should be voted on by the TOC. Other TAG leads elections should be voted by TAG co-chairs, TLs, WG leads or other active contributors of the TAG.

The process of endorsing and selecting individuals will consider the following factors to ensure both the need for proper community representation and the necessary technical expertise: <!-- If the TAG has any additional items, such as leading a minimum number of projects, or facilitating a number meetings, they should be added to this list under "Body of work" -->

* Gender diversity
* Company diversity
* Geo diversity
* Number of nominations from different companies, people, regions for a single individual
* Existing body of work
* Justification provided during nomination

In case there are no individuals expressing interest in taking up leadership positions, an evaluation process for the TAG / working group or project archival may be initiated, as [outlined by the TOC](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#retirement).
