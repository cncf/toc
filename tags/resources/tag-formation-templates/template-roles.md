TAG Chairs are responsible facilitating the working group applications and make sure that the process is done transparent, accessible and traceable for everyone.
One of the TAG chairs serves as the working group sponsor and provides guidance to the working group leads.

## Project Lead

A project lead manages a community group for a specified period of time and works to achieve a specific outcome that has been previously discussed and agreed upon.
Unlike working groups, projects require a predetermined time frame and are limited in scope and focused on a central deliverable. The project proposal must be discussed at a meeting and actively communicated to the entire TAG community.
A TAG Chair or TL acts as a sponsor of the project and dedicates a portion of their time to actively support the effort.
TAG Chairs must sign off on the establishment of the project group.
Due to the limited scope of the role, there are no specific requirements for structuring the selection process for the project lead.  
The TAG Chairs are responsible for selecting a suitable project lead and must ensure that the establishment of the project is transparent, accessible, and understood by all.

## TOC liaison

The [CNCF TAG](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/tags) process identifies a TOC Liaison.
The TAG Chairs are responsible for establishing effective communication with the TOC liaison, including further communication to the wider TOC upon request.

The TOC Liaison will occasionally prioritize TAG activities, as needed by the TOC, to further the [CNCF mission](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation).

## Emeritus Chair

After a TAG Chair completes their term, they transition into the role of Emeritus Chair.
This role does not impose any obligations on the TAG, but it acknowledges their committed time and effort.
The role also lets them share information about their previous work and contributions to the TAG.
An Emeritus Chair retains the same rights/access as in their previous role.
