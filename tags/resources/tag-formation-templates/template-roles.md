# Roles within the `<TAG NAME>`

<!--- **How to complete this template.**  For each area, select the appropriate roles and responsibilities that align with your TAG's expected operation and adjust the language as necessary. Not all TAGs will need or use all roles, or leverage the time limits suggested, and each TAG may choose to redefine or adjust the scope of responsibilities and activities for a given role. The TOC reserves the right to define what TAG Chairs are responsible for, a sample of which have been provided here. --->

The TAG includes several key roles that are critical to the group's success.
Beyond the roles described in this document the TAG has many contributors, all serving in varying capacities.

## Chairs

The TAG Chairs drive, guide, and coordinate the TAG's efforts within the broader CNCF ecosystem and within their TAG's community. They are supported by Technical Leads in the execution of TAG activities
Chairs may be experienced leaders within the CNCF ecosystem and often have specialized domain expertise. Chairs have term limits, most commonly two years. Chairs continue to serve until removed either by an elected replacement or by the TOC.

Chair applications go through an [election process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections) with a final CNCF TOC vote.

The [leadership election process is described here](template-leadership-election-process.md#chair).

Chair responsibilities and expectations may include the following or delegation of the following: 
* Manage the operations and governance of the group.
* Organize, host, plan and facilitate TAG meetings and events.

## Technical lead

A technical lead (TL) expands the bandwidth of the leadership team in terms of covering technical areas, growing the community, organizing events or doing TAG communications.
Applications must have a TL or Chair working as an active sponsor.
TLs are experienced contributors within TAG, often recognized as successful past project leads, through their triage and planning, content and community management, or other attributes the Chairs determine to be valued for the TAG. TLs may be term limited akin to Chairs, the recommended time-frame is two years, but is dependent upon each TAG to define as their needs and activities warrant.
Technical leads go through an [election process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections) with a final CNCF TOC vote.
The [leadership election process is described here](template-leadership-election-process.md#technical-lead).

**A technical lead is expected to**:
* Establish and guide projects and working groups.
* Resolve cross-sub-project technical difficulties and decisions.
* Propose agenda items for meetings to ensure that open issues are discussed with the group when needed.
* Serving as TAG leadership representative in CNCF project discussions and on community events.
* Onboard and mentor new community members.
* Mentor community members in a leadership role within the TAG.
* Enforce and encourage diversity in the TAG efforts.
* Enforce and encourage good communication in the TAG efforts following the [CNCF CoC](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/).
* Support the TAG Chairs.

## Working Group or Project Lead

Depending on the nature of the work being pursued by the TAG, the TAG Leadership may determine, with TOC Liaison approval, that a particular project or effort warrants a longer term project.
Working Groups as community governance structure are defined in the [CNCF TOC](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/workinggroups) repository.
Unlike Working Groups, Projects require a predetermined time frame and are limited in scope and focused on a central deliverable.

A Working Group or Project Lead(s) is an experienced contributor to the TAG that volunteers to lead a scoped activity and group alongside one or two others.
The number of leads may vary greatly depending on the defined scope and level of effort.
Working Group or Project Leads are confirmed by the TAG Leadership and coordinate closely with the TAG Leadership sponsor for the group to keep them apprised of the group's progress and deliverables.
TAG Leadership is responsible for facilitating the group lead applications and ensuring the group's work is done transparently, in a manner accessible and traceable for everyone.
One of the TAG Leadership team (maybe a Chair or TL) serves as the group sponsor and provides guidance to the group leads.
Working Group or Project Lead(s) are signed off by the TAG Chairs, the approval is given by TOC Liaisons.
Should a group need to exist in perpetuity, the TAG Leadership is expected to provide term-limits or opportunities to rotate group leadership as part of their governance.

**The tasks of a working group lead or project lead may include the following**:
* Schedule, host, plan and facilitate meetings for the group.
* Provide technical direction unique to the group.
* Plan group deliverables.
* Report to the TAG on the group status.
* Garner active participation.
* Establish documents and correct permissions for contributions to occur.
* Contribute content to the group.
* Onboard and setup the group lead successor.

## TOC liaison

The [CNCF TAG](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/tags) process identifies a TOC Liaison.
The TAG Chairs are responsible for establishing effective communication with the TOC liaison, including further communication to the wider TOC upon request.

The TOC Liaison will occasionally prioritize TAG activities, as needed by the TOC, to further the [CNCF mission](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation).

For more information on TOC Liaisons, their responsibilities and expectations, please refer to the [TOC Liaisons section of CNCF Tags](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#toc-liaisons).

## Emeritus Chair

After a TAG Chair completes their term, they transition into the role of Emeritus Chair.
This role does not impose any obligations on the TAG, but it acknowledges their committed time and effort.
The role also lets them share information about their previous work and contributions to the TAG.
An Emeritus Chair does/does not retain the same rights/access as in their previous role.
