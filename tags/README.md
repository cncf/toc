# CNCF Technical Advisory Groups ("TAGs")

The CNCF TOC Technical Advisory Groups scale contributions by the CNCF
technical and user community, while retaining integrity and increasing quality
in support of our [mission](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation).

TOC and TOC Contributors have fulfilled TAG duties in the past and will continue to do so until a specific TAG takes on that responsibility.

## TAG Formation Process

TOC will identify at least one voting member as TOC Liason for each [proposed TAG](proposed.md).  The TAG TOC Liason will work with TOC contributors identify prospective chairs and draft the initial charter (see [worked example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ufx6TjPavfZubwrpyMwz6KkU-YA_aHaHmBBQkplnr0/edit?usp=sharing), then submit
a pull request with document referencing the roles and charter, updating the list of current TAGs below.
