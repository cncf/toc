## Subprojects
### Security Assessments
The TAG-Security Security Assessment Subproject is designed to accelerate
the adoption of cloud native technologies based on the below goals and
assumptions:

1. Reduce risk across the ecosystem

   The primary goal is to minimize the risk of malicious attacks and
   accidental privacy breaches. This process achieves this in two ways:

    * Improve detection and resolution of vulnerabilities through a clear
      communication process.
    * Enhance domain expertise in participating projects via collaborative
      assessments.

2. Accelerate adoption of cloud native technologies

   Security assessments are essential but time-intensive processes that
   each company, organization, and project must perform to meet their
   unique commitments to users and stakeholders. In open source, finding
   security-related information can be overwhelmingly difficult and
   time-consuming. The CNCF TAG-Security Security Assessment Process,
   hereafter “TSSA” Process, aims to enhance the discovery of security
   information and streamline internal and external assessments in multiple
   ways:

    * Consistent documentation to reduce assessment time.
    * Baseline of security information to minimize Q&A.
    * A clear security profile rubric for organizations to align their
      risk profiles with the project’s and allocate resources effectively
      (for assessment and needed project contribution).
    * Structured metadata for navigation, grouping, and cross-linking.

This process is expected to raise awareness of how open source projects
impact cloud native security; however, separate activities may be needed
to achieve that purpose using materials generated by the TSSA, known as
artifacts or the TSSA package.
