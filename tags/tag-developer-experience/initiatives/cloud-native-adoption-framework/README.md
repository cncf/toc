# Cloud Native Adoption Framework

https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1917

A developer centric framework to assess, improve, and scale Cloud Native adoption using CNCF projects, grounded in real world workflows and community insight.

## Initiative description

Improving Developer Experience (DevX) in Cloud Native environments requires more than individual tools, it requires a shared understanding of how developers work, where friction exists, and how to iterate toward better workflows using CNCF projects.

This initiative aims to map the modern Cloud Native developer workflow and use it as a foundation for:
• DevX maturity assessments across organizations
• DevX oriented reference architectures and technical guidance
• Shared language and patterns for adoption

Together, these form a cohesive guide and framework to improve Cloud Native Adoption & Developer Experience using CNCF building blocks.

This initiative aims to improve Developer Experience (DevX) in Cloud Native environments by grounding efforts in the real world developer workflow and making CNCF project adoption developer first.

## Deliverable(s) or exit criteria
This track provides a capability- and outcome-based framework to help organizations evaluate, benchmark, and improve the state of Developer Experience (DevX) across the Cloud Native software lifecycle. It combines structured maturity and performance assessments with actionable technical guidance in the form of reference architectures and iterative playbooks. By aligning developer workflows with enabling capabilities and CNCF project integrations, this track supports organizations in identifying friction points, visualizing effective patterns, and making continuous, incremental improvements. The goal is to move beyond static evaluations and provide a practical path toward developer centric, outcome driven Cloud Native adoption.
Specifically, this track includes:

* Maturity assessment across key dimensions such as platform enablement, application team practices, technical capabilities, and organizational culture
* Developer centric outcome measurement (metrics) at the individual, team, and organizational levels to track delivery performance and DevX quality over time
* Reference architectures that illustrate how CNCF projects can be composed to support common developer workflows across the inner and outer loop
* Scenario based playbooks that provide step-by-step guidance for implementing improvements, reducing friction, and adopting CNCF projects incrementally
