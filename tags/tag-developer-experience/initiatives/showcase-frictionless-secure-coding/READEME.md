# Showcasing Frictionless Secure Coding Success Stories and Pain Points in CNCF Projects

https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1943

This initiative collects and analyzes real-world success stories from CNCF projects that have effectively integrated secure coding practices with minimal developer friction. The goal is to distill what worked, why it worked, and how other projects can adopt similar approaches.

## Initiative description

CNCF projects must adopt strong security practices while allowing for a smooth developer experience. This initiative aims to understand both sides of that spectrum. It will identify and document success stories from CNCF projects that have effectively followed TAG Security’s best practices and uncover the pain points and friction that contributors experience when attempting to adopt similar practices.

Rather than proposing a new framework, the initiative emphasizes learning from what already works—and understanding what doesn’t. It will surface:

* Repeatable patterns and tools that have improved security with minimal friction
* Process and cultural practices that enabled successful adoption
* Identify pain points when integrating security requirements within CNCF projects
* By combining insights from successes and challenges, this initiative will help emerging and growing CNCF projects adopt secure coding practices earlier, more smoothly, and with a clearer understanding of where to focus improvement efforts.

## Deliverable(s) or exit criteria

* Secure DevEx Pain Point & Usability Report: Findings from maintainers and contributors, with actionable recommendations.
* Maturity Case Studies: Extracted lessons from established CNCF projects to illustrate effective approaches others can adopt.
