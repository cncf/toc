## ❓ FAQ

### Who should get involved?
- CNCF project maintainers and contributors
- Security engineers interested in DevEx
- Developer experience practitioners
- Technical writers and documentation experts
- Anyone passionate about making security easier

### How much time commitment?
Varies by role:
- **Core contributors:** 4-8 hours/week
- **Case study participants:** 2-3 interviews (1-2 hours each)
- **Reviewers:** Ad-hoc, as deliverables are ready
- **Meeting participants:** 1 hour/week or bi-weekly

### Is this about security OR developer experience?
Both! This initiative treats security as a first-class DevEx concern. We're focused on making security tools and practices easier to adopt and use.

### How does this relate to TAG Security?
We coordinate with TAG Security & Compliance but focus specifically on the developer experience aspects. They're security experts; we're making their guidance more accessible.

### What if my project is just starting?
Perfect! One goal is showing how newer projects can adopt security practices earlier in their lifecycle without major friction.

### What if my project is mature?
Even better! We want to learn from your experience and document what worked (and what didn't) for others to learn from.
