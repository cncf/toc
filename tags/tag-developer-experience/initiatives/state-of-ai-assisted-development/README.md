# State of AI-Assisted Development in CNCF Projects

https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1966

This initiative empowers the CNCF projects to move from ad-hoc experimentation to confident adoption by surveying real-world AI tool usage across CNCF projects and delivering a practical, vendor-neutral guide for secure integration.

## Initiative description

This initiative establishes a comprehensive, observational study of AI-assisted development practices across the entire CNCF ecosystem, targeting projects from Sandbox to Graduated maturity levels. The scope is strictly defined to analyze real-world usage within the software development lifecycle spanning local IDE environments, CI pipelines, and code review processes and more while explicitly excluding any engineering efforts to build tools, train models, or conduct commercial performance benchmarking. Spanning a structured six-month timeline, the initiative will drive the transition from ad-hoc experimentation to confident adoption through the following specific deliverables:

* Month 1: The "State of AI-Assisted Development" Survey: Design and launch a wide-reaching survey aimed at securing responses from at least 30% of CNCF projects. This deliverable focuses on capturing raw data regarding tool selection, usage frequency, and integration points across the community.
* Month 3: Data-Driven Analysis Report: Publication of a public report that synthesizes the survey findings. This document will identify the top 5–10 tools currently in use, map common workflow patterns, and provide a measurable assessment of perceived benefits and security challenges.
* Month 6: Vendor-Neutral Reference Guide The final deliverable is an actionable handbook for maintainers. Based on the analysis, this guide will provide concrete recommendations on security, productivity, and edge-case management, offering a standard set of best practices for integrating AI tools into cloud native project workflows.

By bridging the gap between isolated experimentation and collective intelligence, this initiative delivers immediate, high-impact value to the CNCF ecosystem. It replaces the current uncertainty of AI adoption with a trusted, data-backed roadmap, empowering maintainers to integrate new tools with confidence regarding security and workflow efficiency. Ultimately, this work elevates the standard of the developer experience across all projects, transforming AI-assisted development from a fragmented challenge into a streamlined, secure, and powerful asset for the entire community.
