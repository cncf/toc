# CNCF Technical Advisory Groups ("TAGs")

The CNCF TOC Technical Advisory Groups scale contributions by the CNCF
technical and user community, while retaining integrity and increasing quality
in support of the [CNCF's mission](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation).

TOC and TOC Contributors have fulfilled TAG duties in the past and will continue to do so until a specific TAG takes on that responsibility.
