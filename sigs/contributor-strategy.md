## Introduction
This charter describes the operations of the CNCF Special Interest Group (SIG)
Contributor Strategy. This SIG is responsible for contributor experience,
sustainability, governance, and openness guidance to help CNCF community groups
and projects with their own contributor strategies for a healthy project.

Our initial three stakeholders:  
1 - CNCF projects and their contributors/maintainers,  
2 - End Users in the broader community and member companies,  
3 - TOC

## Mission
Consistent with the CNCF SIG definition, the mission of CNCF SIG Contributor
Strategy is to collaborate on strategies related to building, scaling, and
retaining contributor communities, including (people) governance, communications,
operations, and tools. We want to help grow flourishing, sustainable communities
with smooth journeys throughout their CNCF project lifecycle.  
To do that we will:
* **Create intentional space.** Form a "Maintainers Circle" (name may
  change) comprised of those interested in growing their projects and joining
  fellow maintainers in related cross project discussions.
* **Listen and Advise.** Create informational and training resources including
guides, tutorials and templates of best practices, trade-offs, strategies,
building and participating in scalable contributor communities.
* **Evaluate and Foster.** Helping the TOC with assessments and due diligence of
prospective new projects by developing community graduation criteria check
points for rolling feedback and guidance.
* **Educate and Engage.** Providing guidance to end users on how to engage with
 contributors and vice versa.

#### In scope:
The following, non exhaustive, bootstrap list of activities and deliverables are
in-scope for the SIG:
* Definition of a contributor. This is helpful across projects for metrics and
establishing guidelines, programs, and workflows.
* “Contributing health checks”/’community health checks’ (name tbd) for project
evaluations at graduation time.
* Webinars, meetings, and other events to engage with the end user community on
upstream contributing trainings and engagement programs.  
* Development of guidelines, documents for project governance, recruiting and
retaining contributor communities, mentorship, and project maturity.
* Collection of current state of contributor strategies and governance models
via surveys, GB reps, and Maintainers Circle (Example: what is the project doing
  now, challenges, gaps)

#### Out of scope
* The day to day operations of CNCF SIGs, Kubernetes SIGs, or any community group
of CNCF or its respective projects of any graduation level.
* The creation and approval of CNCF SIGs or other community groups; we will
offer advice but the responsibility lies on the TOC for those matters.
* CNCF operations and marketing initiatives such as: product review/demo
webinars, kubecon event planning, branding, stickers, swag, etc
* Licensing and legal matters
* Testing


## Roadmap
#### 1) SIG Formation
Role creation
Stakeholder reps recruited and identified  

#### 2) Discovery
Who: CNCF SIGs, projects, and end user community  
What: Collect information that will help us assess gaps/needs, inventory
contributor best practices and current operations/programs to identify possible
templates, standards, and more to help projects scale and sustain  
How: Surveys (past data and new), focus groups, crowdsourcing
questions/discussion topics, contributor mailing lists and slack!    

#### 3) Establish working groups
Create them from discovery or already known gaps while #2 is ongoing. Examples
include:  
1. Maintainers Circle
2. Contributor growth and outreach: docs, diversity, recruitment, retention
 * includes modern mentoring, succession planning, and staffing contributor role
  strategies
3. "Community/Contributor health check"
  * evaluation criteria  
  * check-in/review/consulting process  
4. Open governance guidelines and governance operations best practices
  * the why, how, and where, your contributors make decisions  
  * contributor diversity

*Possible future roadmap projects*  
If you see something here that interests you, join us and start it:  
* Training: leadership, code of conduct, code reviewing, etc  
* Contributor metrics and definitions  
* Automation and self service for contributors, community GitOps

## Governance
This SIGs topic requires cross collaboration between end users, CNCF SIGs, and
CNCF projects of all graduation levels.

This SIG should be populated and governed by reps from CNCF projects that want
to create and run intentional contributor experience programs, a rep(s) from the
end user committee, and the TOC liaison(s). While the SIG reps do not need to be
core maintainers, they do need to have a drive for making things better for
contributors and end users. We welcome industry experts and academics in
relevant working groups!

Conduct public monthly meetings as a large group and working groups that form
will have their own meetings. (see #Meetings and Decisions for more)

Check in with the TOC on a monthly basis for a quick overview and challenges
during a public TOC meeting.

### Members

Members are active participants in the work of the SIG who are entitled to vote
in any SIG decisions that require a vote.  Any contributor to the SIG is
eligible to become a member after participating in the work of the SIG for at
least three months.

In order to prevent the SIG from becoming unbalanced, it will have the following
limits on who can be a voting member:

Up to one from each participating Incubating or Sandbox CNCF project
Up to two from each Graduated CNCF project
One from each SIG-ContribStrat Working Group, generally the lead for that WG
No more than ⅓ of members from the same employer

If a contributor would be entitled to be a member, but are restricted because of
the above limits, they are a non-voting member who may participate in meetings
but cannot vote.

Members who are no longer participating actively in the SIG (including both WG
  work and the regular meetings) will step down from membership.

#### Chairs and TOC Liaison

- TOC Liaison: Matt Klein   
- Chairs:
- Tech Leads: None at this time but can change with need at a later time with
charter ratification   

In accordance with the terms and roles laid out in [cncf-sigs.md](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/sigs/cncf-sigs.md)

The TOC will also appoint 3 [Chairs](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/sigs/cncf-sigs.md#chair)

### Meetings and Decisions

Most SIG work will be carried out without requiring any kind of regular meeting
or vote. The SIG will have a regular meeting, initially monthly, at which the
membership may vote on the following items as the come up:

* Addition of new members or removal of inactive ones
* Approval of new working groups and retirement of completed/inactive ones
* Approval of reports to be delivered to the TOC
* Approval of formal recommendations to a CNCF project or about that project to
the TOC
* Approval or deprecation of guidelines and documents

### Bootstrapping

Initially, the TOC shall appoint three members in order to launch the SIG
