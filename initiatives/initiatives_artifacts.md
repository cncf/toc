  # Initiatives Artifacts
  
  [Initiatives](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/governance/tag-governance.md#initiatives) are lightweight organizational units used for TAG or TOC work. They are tightly scoped and time-bound, with specific outputs. The outputs for the initiatives can be submitted for TOC review in the intiatives artifacts folder.
