# Adopter Interview Questions

This template provides the **example set of questions** the TOC leverages in conducting adopter interviews for projects seeking to move levels. The TOC may use all, some, additional questions, or a combination thereof. This template may be linked to for scheduling interviews to that adopters know what to expect.

TOC members will summarize responses to the questions asked in a separate, non-public document until the Adopter approves the content. Once approval is received, the summarized content is copied into the Due Diligence document. Linking to the summary is NOT recommended as it may convey identifying information in the history if not properly access controlled which will circumvent anonymity assurances.

## Setting expectations

The intent of these interviews is to ascertain the maturity and adoption of the project by adopters of the project. They may be public or private.

Expectations conveyance with interviewers: “I’ll record raw notes here, then the notes will be cleaned up and shared with you for your review, correction, and final approval. Once approved, they’ll go into $PROJECT’s due diligence document.”
