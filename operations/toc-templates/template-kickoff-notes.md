## Notes

_This contains notes, observations, and discussion items. This document is shared_

### September check-in
* **DONE(waiting for merge)!** Non-Blocking OpenSSF badging (criteria is for graduation not incubation) - $SUB-PROJECT repo is showing 99%, the only outstanding item: The information on how to contribute SHOULD include the requirements for acceptable contributions (e.g., a reference to any required coding standard). (URL required) [contribution_requirements] .  
  * Looking over the contributing file (recommend linking this on the community contributor ladder as the initial starting point for potential contributors), it does not specify the requirements for acceptable contributions beyond Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).  You'll need to add a section that defines the top level acceptable contributions and links to the community repos acceptable contributions as appropriate.
