# Adopter Interview Request

This template is intended to be leveraged by TOC members in the scheduling of adopter interviews for projects moving levels.

Subject: Adopter Interview Request: CNCF $PROJECT

Message Body

$NAME,

$TOCSPONSORS are the TOC sponsors for $PROJECT's  [Graduation / Incubation]. As part of this process, we interview multiple adopters of the project to ascertain the maturity and adoption of the project. These interviews can be anonymous or attributable - whatever you and the $ADOPTERORG are comfortable with.

Here is a [link](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/operations/toc-templates/template-adopter-questions.md) to the questions I'll be asking, in case you need approval to respond. I try to remain on topic with those questions but may deep dive on a few depending on responses. 

We would like these interviews to be as transparent and public as possible, as it provides invaluable information to the project on improving their features, functionality, and engagement with adopters, but understand if you can only participate anonymously. 

If you, your organization, and/or your responses need to remain anonymous, I will endeavor to summarize to the extent possible and anonymize the content. Before finalizing your responses, they will be shared with you for your review, correction, and approval. Once I have your approval, they will be copied into the due diligence document which provides a summary of the TOC's evaluation of the project's readiness for the next level.

I have the following dates and times available for interviews, these typically run about 30 minutes.

Alternatively you may use my $SCHEDULINGLINK to schedule some time on my calendar:

I understand some organizations need their marketing, PR, or other such approval to participate. We are happy to coordinate with those individuals or include them in the interview. If you have any questions - please let me know. 


Thank you in advance for your willingness to support open source through your participation in this interview and sharing your experience.
