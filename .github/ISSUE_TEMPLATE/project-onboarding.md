Welcome to CNCF Project Onboarding!
This is an issue created to help onboard your project into the CNCF after the TOC has voted to accept your project.
We would like to complete onboarding within one month of acceptance.

From the project side, please ensure that you:

- [ ] Understand the project proposal process and requirements: <https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/project_proposals.md#introduction>
- [ ] Understand the services available for your project at CNCF <https://www.cncf.io/services-for-projects/>
- [ ] Ensure your project meets the CNCF IP Policy: <https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#11-ip-policy>
- [ ] Review the online programs guidelines: <https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/online-programs-guidelines.md>
- [ ] Understand the trademark guidelines: <https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/trademark-usage/>
- [ ] Understand the license allowlist: <https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md#approved-licenses-for-allowlist>
- [ ] Is your project working on written, open governance? see <https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/governance/>
- [ ] Slack: Are your Slack channels migrated to the Kubernetes or CNCF Slack workspace? (see <https://slack.com/help/articles/217872578-Import-data-from-one-Slack-workspace-to-another> for more details)
- [ ] Is your project in its own separate neutral GitHub organization? This will make it transferable to the CNCF's GitHub Enterprise account.
- [ ] Submitted a pull request to add your project as a sandbox project to <https://landscape.cncf.io>
- [ ] Create maintainer list + add to aggregated <https://maintainers.cncf.io> list by submitting a PR to it
- [ ] Artwork: Submit a pull request to <https://github.com/cncf/artwork> with your artwork
- [ ] Domain: transfer domain to the CNCF - <https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/theme/portal/2/create/63>

Things that CNCF will need from the project:

- [ ] Provide emails for the maintainers added to <https://maintainers.cncf.io> in order to get access to the maintainers mailing list and Service Desk - <project-onboarding@cncf.io> is the best email to send those to
- [ ] Trademarks: transfer any trademark and logo assets over to the LF - <https://github.com/cncf/foundation/tree/master/agreements> has agreements
- [ ] GitHub: ensure `thelinuxfoundation`, `caniszczyk`, and `krook` are added as initial org owners, this helps us make sure we have continuity of GH ownership as we onboard your project to our GitHub Enterprise instance: <https://github.com/enterprises/cncf>
- [ ] GitHub: ensure [DCO](https://github.com/apps/dco) or [CLA](https://github.com/cncf/cla) are enabled for all GitHub repositories of the project
- [ ] GitHub: ensure that that the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) (or your adopted version of it) are explicitly referenced at the project's README on GitHub
- [ ] Website: ensure LF footer is there and [website guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/website-guidelines.md) followed (if your project doesn't have a dedicated website, please adopt those guidelines to the README file of your project on GitHub).
- [ ] Website: Analytics transferred to <projects@cncf.io>
- [ ] OpenSSF Best Practices Badge: Start on an OpenSSF Best Practices Badge <https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en>

Things that the CNCF will do or help the project to do:

- [ ] DevStats: add to DevStats <https://devstats.cncf.io/>
- [ ] Insights: add to LFX Insights <https://insights.v3.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/>. This is an app added to the GitHub organization.
- [ ] Marketing: update relevant intro + slide decks
- [ ] Events: update CFP + Registration + CFP Area forms
- [ ] Service Desk: confirm maintainers have read <https://www.cncf.io/services-for-projects/>
- [ ] CNCF welcome email sent to confirm maintainer list access
- [ ] Book time with the team with <http://project-meetings.cncf.io>
- [ ] Create space for meetings/events on <https://community.cncf.io>, e.g., <https://community.cncf.io/pravega-community/> - (<https://github.com/cncf/communitygroups/blob/main/README.md#cncf-projects>)
- [ ] Adopt a license scanning tool, like [FOSSA](https://fossa.com/) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)
