Your annual review should answer the following questions:

[] Include a link to your projectâ€™s devstats page. We will be looking for signs of consistent or increasing contribution activity. Please feel free to add commentary to add colour to the numbers and graphs we will see on devstats.
[] How many maintainers do you have, and which organisations are they from? (Feel free to link to an existing MAINTAINERS file if appropriate.)
[] What do you know about adoption, and how has this changed since your last review / since you joined Sandbox? If you can list companies that are end users of your project, please do so. (Feel free to link to an existing ADOPTERS file if appropriate.)
[] How has the project performed against its goals since the last review? (We won't penalize you if your goals changed for good reasons.)
[] What are the current goals of the project? For example, are you working on major new features? Or are you concentrating on adoption or documentation?
[] How can the CNCF help you achieve your upcoming goals?
[] Do you think that your project meets the criteria for [incubation](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc#incubating-stage)?
