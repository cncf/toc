# TOC Supporting Guides for TAGs

The TOC has a number of [tasks](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/process) that it performs. TAGs act as an extension of the TOC in certain areas, as described [here](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md).
This folder contains guides on how TAGs can support the TOC.

**Guides**:
* [Project Reviews and Engagement](project-reviews.md)
    * [Domain Technical Review template](tag-domain-technical-review-template.md) 
    * [General Technical Review questions](general-technical-questions.md)
* [Technical Paper process](tech-papers.md)
