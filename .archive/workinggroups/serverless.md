## Objective

Explore opportunities to increase the usage of, and the productivity
of developers using, serverless related technologies. Due to the inherit
overlap between serverless and cloud native technologies, the WGs workstreams
may apply to cloud native technologies as well.

* [CloudEvents Project](https://cloudevents.io/)
* [Serverless Workflow Project](https://serverlessworkflow.io/)
