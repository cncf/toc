# Cloud Native Milestones

Milestones are intended to outline checkpoints for projects, that have assisted past projects as they grew and mature in the cloud native ecosystem. They are NOT requirements for moving between levels, please refer to [the graduation criteria](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md) for requirements. 

When leveraged, projects may find their path towards Graduation is more structured, clear, achievable, and allows them to reach maturity in a more robust and well understood manner. Milestones do not guarantee a project’s graduation within the CNCF, rather, they are a collection of key activities that have helped other projects achieve maturity, stability, and adoption. Even after projects are graduated, they may leverage milestones as a mechanism to continue sustaining their project in a manner expected by their community and adopters particularly as they experience change and turnover. The community is welcome to submit PRs to improve and add additional milestones based on their experiences in maturing their projects.

## Sandbox

Some milestones may not apply to all projects and should be leveraged as guiding points. Milestones are described as the desired state with examples for how to achieve this. They are not requirements.
* Project has the basics of security underway
  * Completion of the [self-assessment](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/assessments/guide/self-assessment.md)
* Project holds community meetings or active discussions
  * Zoom with meeting notes occurring more than twice a quarter (or community.cncf.io!) 
  * Use of GitHub discussions, issues, or a group messaging service (slack, wechat, etc.)
* Project guides community contributions
  * PRs from community members receive timely feedback and discussion from the maintainers
* Project works with an angel adopter
  * Partners closely with the project to address organizational needs of the project early on
* Project has a second organization contributing
  * May begin path to maintainership
* Project begins solidifying a versioning schema and release cadence
  * A roadmap or other document clearly defines project direct or initiatives that may align with releases
  * Releases begin to establish a pattern of regularity
* Project has engaged a [Technical Advisory Group](/tags/README.md) for feedback on some portion of the project relevant to the domain
* Project has a clearly discoverable governance doc that covers the basics of decision making and how to earn permissions to approve pull request, sometimes referred to as "the commit bit"
* Project has an angel adopter that assists in stability and production runtime or deployment
* Project has 3 angel adopters
  * May be from different industry verticals
  * May have differing use cases
* TBD - add more!

## Incubation

Incubation milestones are guiding points to highlight success areas a maturing project can accomplish before Graduation. They are not requirements. Not all Incubating projects will achieve every milestone, however many successful graduated projects have demonstrated these milestones prior to their Graduation. How each project achieves some or all of these milestones will vary widely. Projects do not need to meet this in order to graduate, rather these assist projects in meeting the Graduation criteria.
* Project has a robust set of governance documentation that defines how the direction of the project is decided upon and managed which considers company diversity in decision making. [TAG Contributor Strategy](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy) has many great [governance templates](https://github.com/cncf/project-template).
* Project can demonstrate its application, practice, and adjustments to its governance documentation as a result of regular project operations
* Project has a robust and mature security posture which could be achieved by one or more of the following:
  * Threat model
  * [Joint review](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/tree/main/assessments#components-of-the-security-review-package)
  * [Passing level](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria/0) of the [OpenSSF Best Practice Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/)
    * Note: Completion and maintenance of **a** OpenSSF Best Practice Badge is [a requirement for graduation](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md#graduation-stage)
* Project documentation includes getting started guides, operating/administration instruction, security call-outs, and other core elements necessary to ease adoption.
* Project provides information on performance and scalability for deployment options/configurations, autoscaling, or may provide benchmarks in these areas for comparison or evaluation
* Project captures use cases to showcase how it can be best used to solve common problems.
  * These may leverage observations and concerns from adopters
* Project contribution and community documentation clearly defines expectations when contributing (to include non-code contributions).
* Project defines a process to “build the bench” of maintainers and project leaders such as a Contribution Ladder which considers succession planning and getting maintainers from multiple organizations
* Project ensures all sub-projects are clearly defined in their maturity level, whether they ship with the core project or can be used independently but is subject to the same governance processes
* Project refreshes their roadmap planning with a reasonable cadence
* Project has engaged with a few Technical Advisory Groups to ensure they are considering best practices across multiple technical and governance facets
* Project has defined a process for managing the conduct of its community, either establishing its own group to do this, leveraging the existing leadership, or deferring to the CNCF
* Project maintains a dependency graph so adopters fully understand the complexity and risk of use
* TBD - add more!

## Graduation

Graduation milestones are guiding points to highlight continuing success areas for highly mature project after they graduate. They are not requirements. Not all Graduated projects will achieve or perform these milestones, however many robust and mature projects will adopt these milestones as "regular business" to maintain the health and growth of the project and its community.
* Project reviews it's governance process annually for improvements to improve clarity, consistency, and inclusivity
* Project has a well established and exercised contributor growth ladder or other community construct to "build the bench" of maintainers or project leaders
* [Silver level](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria/1) of the [OpenSSF Best Practice Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/)
* Project has an Adopters file and may record public production users and use cases
* Project periodically evaluates their project health and practices.
  * Projects may leverage [CLOMonitor](https://clomonitor.io/) for this information
* TBD - add more!
