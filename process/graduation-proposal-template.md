## Due Diligence

### Project Details

   complements other cloud native (CNCF) projects:
   * ???

1. Scope of the project:
   * primary in-scope use cases supported today:
     * ???
   * planned use cases (in the roadmap):
     * ???

1. Describe how the project is aligned with the
   [CNCF principles](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/PRINCIPLES.md):
   * ???

1. URLs to maintainer and emeritus processes (The processes should cover the
   full maintainer lifecycle including onboarding, offboarding and emeritus
   criteria. This preferably is laid out in a GOVERNANCE.md file and references
   an OWNERS.md file showing the current and emeritus maintainers):
   * ???

1. Is there any external funding for the project beyond what the CNF provides?
   * ???

### Health and Adoption

1. Provide evidence of production deployments that are of high-quality and
   high velocity (e.g. list of independent adopters who are using it in
   production):
   * ???

1. URLs to commit stats of the project (something that shows the rate of change
   in the project, and by which organization, over time, issue/PR velocity
   tracking stats):
   * ???

1. Information about the project's community size and/or sponsorships
   (details to help the TOC guage the popularity and adoption rate of the
   project within the cloud native community):
   ???

1. Compare and contrast with peers in this space (e.g. textual, summary matrix,
   strengths/weaknesses, when would a peer be a better fit for an adopter):
   * ???

### Community

1. Describe the communication mechanisms used within the project team members
   and with the broader community (e.g. email, slack, blogs):
   * ???

1. What is the time commitment to the project? (e.g. how many are full-time vs

   semver):
   * ???

1. URLs to architectural high-level designs and feature overviews of the
   project:
