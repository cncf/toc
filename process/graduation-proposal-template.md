# [Project] Graduation Proposal

_**Insert introduction. See previous proposals for examples. This section should address from a broad perspective why the project feels they are ready to graduation and can state any major accomplishments or milestones.**_

## Graduation State Criteria
_**Project should address each graduation criteria listed below**_

### * Have committers from at least two organizations.

### * Have achieved and maintained a [Core Infrastructure Initiative Best Practices Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/).

### * Have completed an independent and third party security audit with results published of similar scope and quality as [this example](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy#security-audit) which includes all critical vulnerabilities and all critical vulnerabilities need to be addressed before graduation.

### * Explicitly define a project governance and committer process. The committer process should cover the full committer lifecycle including onboarding and offboarding or emeritus criteria. This preferably is laid out in a GOVERNANCE.md file and references an OWNERS.md file showing the current and emeritus committers.

### * Explicitly define the criteria, process and offboarding or emeritus conditions for project maintainers; or those who may interact with the CNCF on behalf of the project. The list of maintainers should be preferably be stored in a MAINTAINERS.md file and audited at a minimum of an annual cadence.

### * Have a public list of Project adopters for at least the primary repo (e.g., ADOPTERS.md or logos on the Project website). For a specification, have a list of adopters for the implementation(s) of the spec. Refer to [FAQs](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/FAQ.md#what-is-the-definition-of-an-adopter) for guidelines on identifying adopters.
