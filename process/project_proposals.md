# CNCF Project Proposal Process v1.5

## Introduction 

This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for projects to be accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (“CNCF”). The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into the CNCF, and new projects to be formed within the CNCF.

## Project stages

### Timelines

#### Expectations

The TOC makes no guarantees on if or when a project will join the CNCF or move levels. Projects apply for moving levels when they feel they are ready. However, what is ready for one project is not the same for another nor is each project’s adoption and maturity measurable against one another. For some projects it may be a long journey with the TOC to bring them to maturity for the kind of project they are and for others it may be shorter - it all depends on the individual project, their readiness, and the availability of the individuals responsible for various tasks in moving levels.

When projects apply for moving levels, they do not move levels on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis. Some projects join the Foundation when they are already far along in their journey and others join very early. They will approach maturity guide posts differently - at different times and in ways similar or different from others. We do our best to support projects moving levels, in some cases engaging with them frequently to ensure they are making progress on our initial findings but leaving the application open.  In other cases, we review the project and finding nothing disparaging, only needing to refresh the content of the previous due diligence, evaluate against the next level of criteria, and move it forward.

For sandbox proposals, applications are reviewed in the order the TOC chooses, most commonly returning applications first and then from oldest application to newest every two months. The TOC may not have time to get through every application each meeting as different project applications carry varying considerations and discussion topics to ensure enough information is discovered and explored to make an informed decision. The up to date list can be found [here](https://sandbox.cncf.io/) and will be carried over from meeting to meeting if not every project is reviewed.

For moving levels to incubation or graduation, projects should plan on _at least 5 months or more_ between the initial application and approval. 

#### KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Freeze

Due to the increased community demands around KubeCon + CloudNativeCon (KCCN), the scheduling and production of content, and reduced availability of individuals involved in moving levels, the TOC leverages a freeze for projects in process for moving levels. Even if a project is approved to move levels 3 weeks before this event, projects should _not_ expect to receive benefits beyond those afforded for the level they were previously at. For example, if a sandbox project is approved to move to incubation 3 weeks prior to the event, the project and the event staff will not have enough time to record, edit, and produce an incubating project update to have it included within the keynote stage reel.

For each KubeCon + CloudNativeCon's (KCCN) standalone event (where KCCN is the focus, not a joint event with OSS Summit or other such conference) — currently Europe and North America — the following freeze is applied:

__Within 6 weeks of the event__

* TOC members will not take on new sponsorship of applications for moving levels
* Many activities occur before, during, and after KCCN. Postponing new sponsorship until after KCCN reduces the likelihood that kicking off the process is overcome by such activities.

__Within 2 weeks of the event__

* Public Comment will not open
 * We want to ensure community members, adopters, and other stakeholders have time to participate in the public comment of projects, the 2 weeks leading up to the event are typically very busy for many individuals involved in the moving levels process.
* Voting for projects will not open
 * Voting is an opportunity for community members to show support for projects, it is also the time when the TOC determines if the due diligence and state of the project support its promotion to the next level. As such it is essential for TOC members to have time to not only cast votes, but to consider any comments raised during the public comment period. The TOC is just as busy as any other attendee or speaker for KCCN, it is easy to miss the timeframes for voting and we want to ensure projects receive the attention in a vote they deserve.
* Open voting is paused
 * While community members may continue to show support for projects, the TOC will officially pause our voting.
* No project announcements
 * Even if a project has passed a vote, if they have not announced and officially moved levels, they will not be included as an incubating or graduated project.

__2nd week following the event__

* Voting for projects who completed public comment may open and commence.
* The week immediately following KCCN is commonly reserved as a recovery and digest period for attendees, event staff, community members, and TOC.

TOC members may choose to continue working with projects on due diligence within the weeks before and after KCCN subject to their and others' availability. Projects should take all of this into account when planning completion of their due diligence. We ask projects to be understanding and considerate of our availability constraints around KCCN and remind everyone that the TOC is not a full-time body, we have primary work commitments in addition to our involvement on the TOC and any projects, TAGs, or community groups we are involved in.

As the CNCF chooses to create new standalone occurrences of KCCN, this freeze should be reviewed to ensure ample time is available to conduct activities to support project moving levels. It may include restricting to just two freezes a year, or a complete re-evaluation of the freeze in light of whatever changes have transpired.

#### Additional information

Q: Why doesn't the TOC get through the sandbox list every meeting?
A: There are currently many projects that want to be a part of the CNCF and it is the TOC's job to carefully consider if they are the right fit for the foundation. This deliberation takes time and there are only so many applications that the TOC can get through each meeting. If anything, a delay from one meeting to the next is a benefit for the project because it allows more time to build community support.

Q: Exactly how long will it take my project to move levels once my application is in?
A: Just like in open source, it will get done when the work is done. This can range from 5 months to 15 months please coordinate with your TOC sponsor to keep everything on track.

Q: Can my project still apply to move levels within 6 weeks of KubeCon?
A: Yes, though getting a TOC sponsor, conducting any due diligence, and any other steps of the process will be delayed until after KubeCon.

Q: Why can't public comment periods or votes launch within 6 weeks of a KubeCon?
A: Undergoing due diligence is a non-insignificant amount of work. Conducting adopter interviews takes time and scheduling becomes increasingly difficult the closer to each KCCN we get. Being able to successfully complete due diligence to launch the public part of the process becomes very difficult as many community members have additional responsibilities related to the conference. By removing KCCN as a goal post for brand new requests to move levels, we hope to not burn out adopters, TOC, maintainers, and other community members.

### Sandbox process

**Note: The TOC has changed the sandbox application process to a more transparent and streamlined workflow within the :package: [Sandbox Applications repository](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox) :package:.**

All exceptions and "declined" or "postponed" outcomes are handled by the TOC. Projects may be encouraged to re-apply after addressing areas called out in the application comments on the corresponding issue. Please refer to the instructions in the [Sandbox repo README](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox) for more details on re-application.

![Sandbox process](sandbox-application-process-2022.png)

#### Applying for Sandbox
   * Projects apply for sandbox through the Sandbox Repo's *[Issue Form](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/new)*. More information on this process is found on the main [Sandbox repo page](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox).

#### Annual Review of Sandbox projects

Once in the Sandbox, projects are subject to an [Annual Review](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/sandbox-annual-review.md).
 
#### Governance / legal issues* 
   * CNCF staff handle governance / legal issues
   * Projects are encouraged to participate/attend TOC meetings and reach out to TAGs for advice or scheduling presentations and discussions.

See the [Sandbox guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/sandbox.md) for the definition of and motivation behind the CNCF Sandbox.

### General steps for moving levels: Incubation and Graduation

While the details of the process are described in detail further for Incubating and Graduting proposals, the high level steps that occur when a project moves levels are as follows:

* Applications to move levels is done in the form of a PR on the TOC repo
  * Who: Project
* As prior applications are closed, the TOC selects the next project from the backlog. A TOC sponsor(s) is assigned and the project is moved to 'Due Diligence' or 'Active Review' on the project boards depending on which level is proposed.
  * Who: TOC
* Coordination with project on Due Diligence creation/refresh
  * Who: TOC Sponsor(s) and Project
* Due Diligence creation or refresh
  * Who: TOC Sponsor(s), Project, TAG(s)
* Adopter Interviews are conducted, depending on the freshness of prior interviews the TOC may choose to not conduct further interviews or conduct others to ensure coverage by a variety of adopters to explore all facets of the project. The project is updated on the project board.
  * Who: TOC Sponsor(s) and Adopters
* If multiple TOC members are sponsoring, they will conduct their own individual reviews and then coordinate with each other on overall observations, findings, and next steps.
  * TOC Sponsors
* TOC sponsor(s) re-engages the project to discuss next steps, any blockers that prevent the project from moving, and any actions that need completed but are non-blocking.
  * Who: TOC Sponsor(s) and Project
* Assuming all outstanding issues are resolved, the TOC opens an internal comment period, about 1 week, for other TOC members to perform an independent review and verify all areas of the project have been evaluated
  * Who: TOC Sponsor(s) and TOC
* If no further issues are identified, the TOC sponsor(s) open the public comment period on the TOC mailing list. The project is updated on the project board to 'Public Comment' and **the public comment period is open for two weeks**.
  * Who: TOC Sponsor(s)
* Provided no additional items are identified during the public comment period, the TOC opens voting on the mailing list shortly thereafter (usually about 2 days subject to availability). The project is updated on the project board to 'In Voting'.
  * Who: Initiate - CNCF Support Staff for the TOC, Voting - TOC and community members
* If the vote passes, the results are emailed and the project is placed in the 'Done' state on the project board.
  * Who: CNCF Support Staff for the TOC
* An announcement is made conveying the project name and its new level status.
  * Who: CNCF

#### Incubation process

Note: We have [streamlined the Incubation process](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J9nti4JdiwLHxY15KtkmqyfP4OgNfrLAd3vxPvFTzsc/edit?usp=sharing).

All exceptions (and "no" outcomes) are handled by the TOC.

![Incubation Process](incubation-process.png)

##### Project Proposal
   * Incubation proposed through a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pulls)
   * The proposal moves to Due Diligence when a TOC member steps forward as an Incubation Sponsor - Please avoid contacting TOC members individually to serve as project sponsor.
   * The status of outstanding Incubation proposals is reported on a monthly basis in the TOC public meeting. This highlights projects looking for sponsorship, and provides a check-in on DD progress for sponsored projects. 
   * A potential sponsor can indicate that they are interested but don't have capacity to work on DD at this time, to set a project's expectations.
   * The TOC may agree that the project does not (yet) meet the [Incubation requirements](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md#incubation-stage) and give feedback on why this is the case. If the project is not already in the CNCF, the TOC may suggest that project apply for Sandbox instead.
   * If a TOC Incubation Sponsor has not stepped forward within two months after the proposal PR is submitted, projects may request that their project proposal is discussed at a forthcoming TOC meeting by adding it to the [Working Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jpoKT12jf2jTf-2EJSAl4iTdA7Aoj_uiI19qIaECNFc/edit). The outcome of this is discussion is either that a sponsor steps forward, or that the TOC votes to admit the project to Sandbox, or the proposal is rejected (projects may reapply after six months). If, even after all those steps, a sponsor does not step forward, the proposal is rejected. 
   * DD will usually involve a presentation to a TAG, but an interested TAG is welcome to schedule a project presentation at any time. TAGs can discuss their recommendations or concerns about a project with their TOC liaison(s) if there isn't already a TOC Incubation Sponsor in place. 
   * Although it is not necessary, projects are allowed to informally reach out to TOC members for advice, including asking about potential sponsorship. TOC members should keep each other informed about these approaches so that we can avoid falling prey to "lobbying" (directly contacting a TOC member to volunteer or manage an action or issue). There is a fine line between a project asking for help to make a successful application, and a project shopping around looking to pressurize a TOC member into sponsorship.

##### TOC Incubation Sponsor
   * TOC Incubation Sponsor is responsible for driving the process, and co-ordinating with TAGs for review and input as they see fit. 
   * TOC Incubation Sponsor is a point of contact for the project throughout the process.
   * TOC members may not sponsor a project for which they have a clear conflict of interest (for example, originating primarily from their organization). This doesn't mean that they can't have any involvement at all - for example, contributing pull requests, or being an [adopter](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/FAQ.md#what-is-the-definition-of-an-adopter) of that project, can signal a healthy interest in and knowledge of a worthwhile project.

##### Due Diligence (2-3 months)
   * TOC Incubation Sponsor drives due diligence (see the [template](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/dd-review-template.md) and [guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/due-diligence-guidelines.md)).
   * TOC Incubation Sponsor can delegate DD work to CNCF TAGs and/or other TOC members.
   * Typically DD includes a presentation to a CNCF TAG, as identified by the TOC Sponsor. This step may be omitted if the TOC Sponsor feels there are readily-available and suitable presentations on video - for example, because the TAG has already recently held a presentation. (We do not want unnecessary levels of process or bureaucracy to delay a widely-known and adopted project from joining the CNCF). TOC Sponsor has discretion to arrange alternatives (for example, arranging a Q&A session at a TOC meeting) to ensure there is ample opportunity to ask questions.
   * TOC Incubation Sponsor can ask project maintainers to complete the DD template. (In practice project maintainers sometimes choose to make a start on this in advance of the official DD process, or even in advance of the initial proposal as it may help them ensure they meet all the requirements.) The TOC Incubation Sponsor should carefully review and ask questions about the DD as prepared by the project maintainers, and may also call on TAGs to help with this. 
   * CNCF staff do governance and legal DD.
   * During DD some conversations may be held in private (e.g. adopter interviews where the adopter wishes to remain anonymous) and are documented using discretion.
     * TOC members are not required to identify the kind of direct adopter an interviewed organization is, rather they should use their discretion and the guidelines defined in the [FAQs](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/FAQ.md#what-is-the-definition-of-an-adopter) for selected organizations to be interviewed and the nature of the interview as it best assists projects, this may include conducting a combined interview of direct and transitive adopters to ascertain maturity and interaction.
   * TOC Incubation Sponsor confirms that project meets the [Incubation requirements](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md#incubating-stage).
   * TOC Incubation Sponsor determines when DD is “done”. DD documentation should then be on GitHub, open to public comment on record.

##### Due Diligence review (2-6 weeks)
   * TOC Incubation Sponsor announces on the TOC mailing list when the DD documents are available for public review and comment, which can take place on GitHub, the TOC mailing list, or at TOC public meetings. 
   * TOC Incubation sponsor decides when to call TOC vote, allowing at least two weeks for public comment before calling vote

##### TOC vote (up to 6 weeks)
   * TOC members assess whether project meets the [Incubation criteria](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md#incubating-stage)
   * Projects get accepted to incubation via a 2/3 supermajority vote of the TOC.
   * If the vote is not conclusive after 6 weeks, TOC chair may extend vote, or conclude that silence = abstain

#### Graduation process

##### Submit Graduation Proposal Template
   * Project fills out and submits the [graduation proposal template](graduation-proposal-template.md) in a pull request in the [cncf/toc GitHub repo](https://github.com/cncf/toc).
   * The file containing the proposal should be located in [the graduation proposals directory](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/proposals/graduation).
   * The proposal addresses how the project has grown since incubation and any concerns from incubation DD in addition to the standard graduation requirements.
   * Projects will be reviewed on a rolling basis as they apply, instead of two meetings a year.    

##### Public comment
If a TOC member steps forward to support the project as a sponsor and determines the Graduation DD document is finalized, the TOC member kicks off two week period of time for public comment on the TOC mailing list.
   * Please avoid contacting TOC members individually to serve as project sponsor.
   * The email should contain a link to the proposal pull request and graduation DD document.
   * All TAGs, adopters, TOC members, and community members are welcome to comment at this time on the mailing list.
   * Historically, projects have done a TOC presentation as part of the graduation process. The TOC has gotten rid of the presentation requirement. 
* If the TOC does not sponsor the project to move forward at that time, they will provide feedback to the project and the PR will be closed. 
* If the Graduation DD document is not finalized, the TOC sponsor will begin the process to refresh the existing DD document and begin the public comment process.

##### TOC vote
   * TOC members assess whether project meets the [Graduation criteria](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md#graduation-stage)
   * Projects must have a 2/3 supermajority vote of the TOC to graduate

#### Notes

* TOC always has final discretion
* TOC doesn’t have to accept TAG recommendation
* Outcome may be “no” simply because sponsors don’t step forward within the timeframe
* Outcome from TOC Triage or TAG recommendation could be that we want to wait for some reason e.g. project backlogs; batching similar projects together. We should give the project an explanation and set time expectations in these cases.
* All “no” outcomes and other exceptions are discussed by the TOC, and then with project and TAG representatives. We will try to give feedback but it may simply be a lack of conviction in the project.
* If the project is concerned about the timeline, feels they have waited too long, or needs to reach out, please reach out to the TOC via one of their mailing lists or contact the CNCF Staff.
* Projects are encouraged to participate/attend TOC meetings and reaching out to TAGs for advice or scheduling presentations and discussions.
