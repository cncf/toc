# Background

Fluid is an open source Kubernetes-native Distributed Dataset Orchestrator and Accelerator for data-intensive applications, such as big data and AI applications. It primarily provides the following features:

* **Native Support for DataSet Abstraction**: Fluid provides data warm-up and acceleration for cloud applications by using a distributed cache engine (Alluxio) in Kubernetes with Observability, Portability and Horizontal Scalability.

* **Cloud Data Warming up and Accessing Acceleration**: Fluid provides data warm-up and acceleration for cloud applications by using a distributed cache engine (Alluxio) in Kubernetes with Observability, Portability and Horizontal Scalability.

* **Co-Orchestration for Data and Application**: During application scheduling and data placement on the cloud, taking both the app's characteristics and data location into consideration, to improve the performance.

* **Support Multiple Namespaces Management**: User can create and manage datasets in multiple namespaces.

* **Support Heterogeneous Data Source Management**: Unify the Data access for OSS, HDFS, CEPH and Other underlayer storages.

Here are several key concepts:

* **Dataset**: A DataSet is a set of data logically related that can be used by computing engines, such
  as Spark for big data analytics and TensorFlow for AI applications. Intelligently leveraging data
  often creates core industry values. Managing DataSets may require features in different
  dimensions, such as security, version management and data acceleration. We hope to start with data
  acceleration to support the management of datasets.
* **Runtime**: The execution engine that enforces dataset security, provides version management and data
  acceleration capabilities. The Runtime defines a set of interfaces to mangage DataSets in their
  life cycle, so the management and acceleration of datasets can be implemented behind these
  interfaces.


### Alignment with CNCF

- Fluid was accepted as a CNCF Sandbox project on April 28th, 2021.

- Enhance cache warmup feature
- Disk resource management for better cache scheduling

At the same time, the community has been committed to the maintenance of the documentation such as adding more examples or video for new features.
Besides, the [Fluid website](https://fluid-cloudnative.github.io/) is under maintenance all the time.

# CNCF Membership

It can be seen from the performance of the last year that Fluid has received a lot of benefits since joining the CNCF Sandbox project.
We hope that CNCF can increase the promotion of Fluid so that Fluid will have more opportunities to show its work and gain more contributors and users.

## How the CNCF can help to achieve the upcoming goals
Similar to many other Sandbox projects, we wish to get the following help from CNCF:
- More channels to advocate the project.
- More chances to collaborate with other projects in CNCF or even out of CNCF.
- Technical writing support for project documents.

# Incubation readiness

Fluid intends to remain a CNCF Sandbox project currently. We are not ready to apply for the CNCF Incubation project yet since we have joined the CNCF Sandbox project just for a relatively short time.
In the future, we are intended to develop more committers, contributors and users, and then we will consider applying for the CNCF Incubation project.
