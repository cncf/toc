_Linkerd is currently an inception stage CNCF project._

To be accepted to incubating stage, a project must meet the inception stage requirements plus:

* Document that it is being used successfully in production by at least three independent end users which, in the TOCâ€™s judgement, are of adequate quality and scope.

    * [https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)
    * (Several non-public adopters that we know of that we can share privately if you desire.)

* Have a healthy number of committers. A committer is defined as someone with the commit bit; i.e., someone who can accept contributions to some or all of the project.

    * [https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md)
