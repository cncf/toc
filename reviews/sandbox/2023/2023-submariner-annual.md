## Adoption

Submariner has adopters actively using it in production for a variety of use cases.
We haven't discussed identifying users, but see the Add Public Adopters goal.

https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner/blob/devel/ADOPTERS.md

## Performance Against Past Goals

### Added Adopters

One of our goals for Submariner was to increase the number of adopters. We've accomplished this to a significant extent.
We seem to have quite a few users doing a variety of interesting things with Submariner and subsets of Submariner.
We'll continue trying to grow Submariner's user community.

### Didn't Add Committers from Groups other than Red Hat

Another goal for Submariner was to add Committers or Owners from groups other than Red Hat. We have not accomplished this goal.
We'll continue being welcoming to new contributors, doing our best to encourage them to contribute and
[become Committers](https://submariner.io/community/contributor-roles/#committer-requirements).

## Future Goals

### Add Public Adopters

Talk to users about being listed in our ADOPTERS.md file along with a summary of their usage.

### Grow Community

Continue to foster a welcoming community of Submariner contributors.

## CNCF Help with Goals

We appreciate Amye's help with our trademark transfer. We don't have any other requests from CNCF at this time.

## Incubation

We're interested in applying for Incubation, but we'd like to accomplish our Add Public Adopters goal first.
