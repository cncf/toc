# WasmEdge Runtime-2022-Annual Review

## Background

WasmEdge is a lightweight, high-performance, and extensible WebAssembly runtime. It is the fastest Wasm VM today. The WasmEdge Runtime provides a well-defined execution sandbox for its contained WebAssembly bytecode program. The runtime offers isolation and protection for operating system resources (e.g., file system, sockets, environment variables, processes) and memory space. The most important use case for WasmEdge is to safely execute user-defined or community-contributed code as plug-ins in a software product (e.g., SaaS, software-defined vehicles, edge nodes, or even blockchain nodes). It enables third-party developers, vendors, suppliers, and community members to extend and customize the software product.

The ultimate goal for WasmEdge is to bring cloud-native and serverless application paradigms to edge, streaming, web3, and SaaS computing environments.

The unique features and advantages of WasmEdge include the following.

* Cross-platform support
  * Linux OSes dated back to 2010 for both x86 and ARM CPUs
  * Mac OS X for both x86 and m1 CPUs
  * Windows
  * Microkernel and RTOS (e.g., the highly secure [seL4 microkernel](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-sel4))
* Easy extensibility
  * Build customized runtimes with native functions in [C](../embed/c/ref.md#host-functions) or [GO](../embed/go/ref.md#host-functions)
* Easy to embed into a host application
  * Embed WasmEdge functions in [C](../embed/c.md), [Go](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/extend-golang-app-with-webassembly-rust/), [Rust](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/tree/master/bindings/rust), [Node.js](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-rust-function/) and Python host applications
  * Embedded function runtime for service mesh proxies (e.g., [proxy-wasm](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-cpp-host/pull/193) for Envoy and MOSN proxies)
