# FabEdge Sandbox Annual Review

## Background

FabEdge is a secure container networking solution based on Kubernetes, focusing on edge computing. It enables cloud-edge,  edge-edge collaboration and solves the problems including complex  configuration management, network isolation, unaware of the underlying  topology, etc. It supports weak network, such as 4/5G, WiFi, etc. The  main use cases are IoT, IoV, smart city, etc.

FabEdge supports the major edge computing frameworks ,like KubeEdge/SuperEdge/OpenYurt.

FabEdge not only supports edge nodes (remote nodes joined  to the cluster via an edge computing framework such as KubeEdge), but  also edge clusters (standalone K8S clusters).

We're are collaborating students from colleges to develop this project. 

## Adoption

* BoCloud

*PS: We have people asked questions but don't have any proof that they're using it in their products.*

## Goals Since Last Review

This is the project’s first annual review, but since FabEdge joined CNCF, we have 4 releases which includes major features like:

* Multi-cluster communication and cross-cluster DNS service.
* Dual-stack network.
* Hole-punching to enable edge nodes to establish VPN tunnels betwwen each other even if NAT network exists.
* Auto-networking on edge nodes in the same LAN. 
* Provide coredns and kube-proxy capability on edge side.

## Current Project Goals

The goal of FabEdge this year is to increase the diversity in both contributors and adoption. Some key works include:

- Provide more documents and videos to help users.
- Improve compatibility with different linux distros, kubernete, k3s and Kubeedge/OpenYurt/SuperEdge.
- Add more unit tests.
- Implement more features like HA solution,  support other VPN softwares or vxlan.
- Support more modes of flannel and calico.

## How the CNCF can help to achieve the upcoming goals

We can manage it ourself for now.

## Incubation

We're not ready for that.
