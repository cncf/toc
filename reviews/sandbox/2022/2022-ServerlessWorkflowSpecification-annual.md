## Background

Serverless Workflow is a vendor-neutral, open-source, and fully community-driven ecosystem 
for defining and running DSL-based workflows that target the serverless technology domain.

This project is composed of:

* [Specification](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/main/specification.md) for defining DSL-based workflows.
* [Developer SDKs](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification#sdks) that provide support for many programming languages.
* [Workflow runtimes](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification#runtime) part of the project ecosystem, and support the execution of specification DSL.
* [Developer tooling](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification#Tooling) support for writing DSL-based workflows.

Serverless Workflow was approved as a Cloud Native Sandbox level project on July 14, 2020.

* [TOC review PDF](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/main/community/presentations/2020-4-15-toc-pres.pdf).
* [TOC sandbox proposal PR](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/376)

## Alignment with Cloud Native

Serverless Workflow project falls under the [CNCF "App Definition and Development"](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=app-definition-and-development&grouping=category) category.

Serverless Workflow is a member project of the [CNCF Serverless Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless).

Serverless Workflow includes [Synapse](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/synapse), a Kubernetes-native runtime engine for executing workflows that follows the specification DSL definition.

In addition, Serverless Workflow provides support for several other open-source projects and specifications in the cloud-native
space:

* CloudEvents
* OpenAPI
* AsyncAPI
* GraphQL
* OData
* OAuth2

## Year in Review

This year was for stabilization and discussions around the upcoming 1.0 release. The ecosystem kept growing:

* Two new releases for the [sdk-java](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-java/releases)
* One new release for the [sdk-typescript](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-typescript/releases)
* Four new releses for the [sdk-go](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-typescript/releases)
* Seven minor releases for the [sdk-net](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-net/tags)
* Four minor releases for the [Synapse](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/synapse/releases) runtime
* Added [sdk-python](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-python), a Python SDK into our ecosystem

From the community perspective we also had a good year:

<!-- I couldn't get this number for Twitter 
* Over 100 new followers on our [twitter channel](https://twitter.com/CNCFWorkflow).
-->
* Over 210 new stars on our [specification github repo](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification).
* Over 200 people attending our project kiosk at KubeCon NA 2022
* Presented in-person at KubeCon EU 2022 for more than 100 people.
* Over 200 people attending our project office hours at 2022 KubeCon EU.
* Over 50 people attending our project office hours at 2022 KubeCon China.

## Annual Review Contents

- **Include a link to your projectâ€™s devstats page. We will be looking for signs of consistent or increasing contribution activity.**

Project [DevStats page](https://serverlessworkflow.devstats.cncf.io).

- [Temporal](https://temporal.io/), Temporal is the open source microservice orchestration platform for writing durable workflows as code.

There are a few other companies that are in touch with us and using the specification, but can't disclose at the moment.

- **How has the project performed against its goals since the last review?**

This is our second annual review since becoming a Sandbox project.
This year we looked for stabilization of the specification by having more
discussions with current implementation project leaders to achieve a good
balance between the standards and production-level use cases.

We decided to grow slowly and now we are reaching to a point to fix most of
the open issues and discussions before releasing 0.9 version, and then the final
1.0 by the end of the year.

One of the goals we achieved, was to set a new governance model to balance the
responsibilities amongst all the maintainers.

We had to do a little detour duo to the progress of projects implementing and using
the specification in many production-level use cases.

- **What are the current goals of the project?**

Specification [roadmap](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/tree/main/roadmap) and [progress tracker](https://github.com/orgs/serverlessworkflow/projects/1/views/2).

Our main goals for the project include:

- Release specification version 1.0 by late 2023
- Create a specification TCK
- Add integrations with different workflow DSLs
- Improve our community tooling support

- **How can the CNCF help you achieve your upcoming goals?**

- Help us in promoting the project (Blogs, Twitter, KubeCon, etc)
- If feasible help our project via crowdfunding [here](https://crowdfunding.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/serverless-workflow)
- Keep providing us with opportunities to have project office hours and talks at KubeCons

- **Do you think that your project meets the criteria for incubation?**

We believe we have made significant progress toward this goal and that the project is ready for incubation.
We would like however to release Serverless Workflow specification v1.0 before starting this process
(scheduled for late 2023).
