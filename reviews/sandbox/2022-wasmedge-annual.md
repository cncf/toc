With each release, WasmEdge delivers important features that are important to cloud-native users.

* Advanced networking with the WasmEdge sockets library. It supports non-blocking sockets, DNS, TLS. That allows WadmEdge to run modern HTTPS client and server applications. 
* Support for the Rust Tokio library. It allows many Tokio-based async Rust applications, especially async networking apps, to run seamlessly on WasmEdge.
* Container and K8s tooling. WasmEdge is an OCI-compliant runtime, so it could be managed and orchestrated by K8s and K8s tooling, like crun, youki, runwasi, containerd, CRI-O, K8s, Kind, OpenYurt, KubeEdge, SuperEdge.
* An officil package in Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) distributions. 
* JavaScript support. WasmEdge now supports the full JavaScript language spec as well as common JavaScript module systems, including ES6, CommonJS (CJS), and NPM modules.
* Support for WebAssembly feature extensions such as WASI-NN and WASI-Crypto.
* Support for optional WebAssembly specs and proposals from the community, including the SIMD proposal, the Tail Call proposal, the extended-const proposal, the multi-memories proposal, the Import/Export mutable globals proposal, the Non-trapping float-to-int conversions proposal, the Sign-extension operators proposal, the Multi-value proposal, the Reference Types proposal, the Bulk memory operations proposal and the threads proposal.
* Improved cross-platform compatibility. WasmEdge added support for macOS, Windows, Andriod, seL4, OpenWRT, RISC-V, and OpenHarmony operating systems, as well as ARM32, ARM64, Apple M1 and M2 hardware.
* Enhanced host SDKs in C, Rust, and Go languages.
* A host / Wasm data binding toolkit called the `wasmedge-bindgen`.
* A new plugin system that makes WasmEdge native host functions and extensions easier to develop and install.
* A lot of performance improvements.

The WasmEdge community has expanded its collaboration with many open-source projects in the cloud-native space in the last year. Some of these projects now have production customers using WasmEdge.

* OpenFunction (CNCF project) supports WasmEdge as a container runtime.
* WebAssembly Languages Runtime, maintained by VMWare, supports WasmEdge as a runtime
* LF Edge eKuiper and shifu uses WasmEdge to process data streamed from IoT devices.
* Kuasar supports WasmEdge as a container runtime.
* containerd's runwasi supports WasmEdge as a container runtime.
* youki, the OCI Container Runtime, supports WasmEdge as a container runtime.
* Essa-rs ueses WasmEdge to execute serverless functions on the essa-rs platform.
* The OpenGauss and libsql communities used WasmEdge to power UDFs (User Defined Functions) in database queries.
* Apache Traffic Server uses WasmEdge as a plugin to process the traffic flow.

Another highlighted collaboration is that Docker Desktop integrates WasmEdge to support Wasm containers.

Furthermore, the WasmEdge project is used by numerous commercial companies including Docker, VMWare, FutureWei, Huawei, 5miles, and ByteDance. You can check out the full list [here](https://wasmedge.org/docs/contribute/users).

## Project goals

This is the WasmEdge project's second Annual review after joining the CNCF Sandbox.

For the immediate future, WasmEdge will focus on the following areas.

* Technical goals
    * Support more WebAssembly proposals and specs, such as threading, stack switching, logging, and debugging. In particular, we aim to be one of the first Wasm runtimes to fully support the WebAssembly component model spec.
    * Improve support for microservices. We will enable WasmEdge applications to access commonly used databases, messaging services, proxies, sidecars, and other services.
    * Improve support for data streaming functions. We will work with data streaming partners to support embedded functions in WasmEdge in those frameworks.
    * Improve support for AI inference workloads in Wasm. We will continue adding support for popular models in computer vision, voice recognition, and document AI. We will also enable inference on LLMs such as Llama.
    * Support AI training on Wasm. We are collaborating with ByteDance and the Ray community to support WasmEdge on Ray nodes.
    * Support the complete Node.js API and NPM module ecosystem in WasmEdge's JavaScript runtime.
    * Improve WasmEdge support in popular application frameworks such as Dapr, Spin, etc.
    * Better support for host SDKs in Rust, Go, Java, and Python for embedding WasmEdge in other applications.
    * Debugging, monitoring, and observability tools for WasmEdge.
    * Further optimize the developer experience and user experience for WasmEdge plugins. That would make it easy for the community to add new features to WasmEdge.


Our 2023 roadmap could be found [here](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/blob/master/docs/ROADMAP.md).

* User adoption goals
    * Drive adoption through integrating more open-source projects. 
    * Continue working closely with end-users to bring WasmEdge into production systems in at least 3-5 commercial companies.

* Community and community collaborations
    * Recruit and support proposal maintainers from more companies other than Second State.
    * More community collaborations with open source projects in Linux Foundation and Apache Foundation.
    * Attending continuously the mentorship programs like [Google Summmer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs), [LFX mentorship](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/) and [Open Source Program Plan](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/) to drive community contributions by students.

## How the CNCF can help to achieve the upcoming goals

In the past two years, the WasmEdge project has received significant support from the CNCF. That includes LFX Mentorship opportunities, publication of tech articles on the CNCF blog, Project Pavilion and Office Hour opportunities at KubeCon, and legal support for the WasmEdge trademark in the US and China. Going forward, we plan to work closely with the CNCF on the following additional areas.

* Strategy to recruit and retain contributors.
* Guidance and support for the project's technical documentation.
* Opportunities to collaborate with other CNCF projects.

## Incubation readiness

The WasmEdge team believes that the project is incubation ready, and had [submitted a incubation proposal](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/1102).
