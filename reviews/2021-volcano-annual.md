## Background

[Volcano](https://volcano.sh/en/) is a system for running high-performance workloads on Kubernetes. It features powerful batch scheduling capability that Kubernetes cannot provide but is commonly required by many classes of high-performance workloads, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Big Data, Bioinformatics Computing, etc. These types of workloads typically run on generalized domain frameworks like TensorFlow, Spark, PyTorch, MPI, etc. Volcano is integrated with these frameworks to allow users to run their applications without extra adaptation efforts while enjoying remarkable batch scheduling.


**Volcano provides:**
1. Powful support to mainstream computing architectures such as Spark/Flink/Tensorflow/PyTorch.
2. Rich advanced scheduling strategies including Gang Scheduling/Backfill/Bin-pack, etc.
3. Support mixed scheduling of heterogeneous resources, e.g. CPU, Memory, GPU, etc.


**Volcano was accepted as a CNCF Sandbox project on Apr 10, 2020.**

## Alignment with Cloud Native

Volcano falls in the scope of [CNCF Runtime SIG](https://github.com/cncf/sig-runtime).


**Volcano targets on:**
  - leveraging high performance (especially AI/Big Data/HPC) workloads, to run on Kubernetes
  - providing unified API for all computing architectures
  - providing rich and scalable scheduling strategies framework
  - supporting heterogeneous devices such as GPU/FPGA
