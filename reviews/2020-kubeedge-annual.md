## Background

[KubeEdge](https://kubeedge.io/en/) is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. It's built upon kubernetes and provides fundamental infrastructure support for network, application deployment and metadata synchronization between cloud and edge.

It aims to resolve three major challenges for edge computing: network reliability and bandwidth limit between cloud and edge, resource constraint at edge, highly distributed and heterogeneous device management.

**KubeEdge provides:**
1. Seamless Cloud-Edge Communication for both metadata and data
2. Edge Autonomy: Autonomous operation of Edge even during disconnection from cloud.
3. Low Resource Ready: KubeEdge can work in constrained resource situations (low memory, low bandwidth, low compute)
4. Simplified Device Communication: Easy communication between application and devices for IOT and IIOT


**KubeEdge was accepted as a CNCF Sandbox project on Mar 18, 2019.**
- [KubeEdge Sandbox Proposal](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/proposals/sandbox/kubeedge.adoc)
- [Original CNCF TOC meeting slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e1ahun91Abn2xvX7Z8PVgGBz6c7Q7iO027XVzVuffDg/edit#slide=id.g25ca91f87f_0_0)

## Alignment with Cloud Native

KubeEdge falls in the scope of [CNCF Runtime SIG](https://github.com/cncf/sig-runtime).

**KubeEdge targets on:**
  - building an open edge computing platform with cloud native technologies
  - helping users extending their business architecture, applications, services, etc. from cloud to edge in same experience
  - implementing extensible architecture based on Kubernetes
  - integration with CNCF projects, including (but not limited to) containerd, cri-o, Prometheus, etc.
  - seamless development, deployment and run complex workloads at edge with optimized resources
