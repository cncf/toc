# Envoy Graduation Application

Envoy was OSSd in September, 2016 and joined the CNCF in September, 2017. The project has grown
significantly over time.

The following application links to the required information to become a graduated project.

## Envoy fulfills all the incubating and graduation criteria:

### Document that it is being used successfully in production by at least three independent end users which, in the TOCâ€™s judgement, are of adequate quality and scope.

* Known end users include: AirBnb, Alibaba, Apple, Booking.com, Cookpad, DigitalOcean, eBay, Google, GO-JEK,
  GroupOn, IBM, Lyft, Medium, Microsoft, Netflix, Pinterest, Salesforce, Snap, Square, Stripe, Tencent, Twilio,
  Two Sigma, Uber, Verizon, VMware, VSCO, Yahoo Japan, and Yelp. Many of these logos are listed
  [here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). This is not an exclusive list and it's likely that
  other organizations are also Envoy users.
* Envoy is being used by numerous other companies, both large and small, to build higher layer
  products and services. This includes Covalent, Datawire, HashiCorp, Heptio,
  Istio (F5 Networks, Google, IBM, RedHat, Tetrate, Tigera, VMware, etc.), Solo.io,
  and many others.

### Have a healthy number of committers. A committer is defined as someone with the commit bit; i.e., someone who can accept contributions to some or all of the project.

See the current list of [Envoy owners](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/OWNERS.md),
who are also committers. Currently, we have 11 and are on the constant lookout for new maintainers
to join our ranks.

### Demonstrate a substantial ongoing flow of commits and merged contributions.

### Have committers from at least two organizations.

We currently have [11 committers](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/OWNERS.md) from
5 organizations.

### Have achieved and maintained a Core Infrastructure Initiative Best Practices Badge.

### Adopt the CNCF Code of Conduct.

https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

### Explicitly define a project governance and committer process. This preferably is laid out in a GOVERNANCE.md file and references an OWNERS.md file showing the current and emeritus committers.

https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md

### Have a public list of project adopters for at least the primary repo (e.g., ADOPTERS.md or logos on the project website).

See https://www.envoyproxy.io/.
