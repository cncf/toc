# Microcks Incubation Due Diligence

- [Microcks Incubation application issue](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1552)

<!-- This template provides the TOC with the outline for completing due diligence of a project to move levels. This universal template is designed to capture all criteria so the TOC may ensure prior level criteria do not regress. As part of completing the due diligence, the TOC member should update the template to convey the level the project applied for the criteria by bolding the level indicated where the criteria is relevant. -->

## Incubation Evaluation Summary for Microcks

## Application Process Principles

### Suggested

N/A

### Required

- [x] **Engage with the domain specific TAG(s) to increase awareness through a presentation or completing a General Technical Review.**
  - _If applicable_ this was completed and occurred on DD-MMM-YYYY, and can be discovered at $LINK.

<!-- (TOC Evaluation goes here) --> 
The project presented to the former TAG App Delivery on February 19, 2025, during the TAG General Meeting. The recording is available on the [TAG YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmGNJQUMlfo&t=856s). The presented deck can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dQpmqwOKFroAHPzhAzSXip1AnM96WUH-9UrVNiBgtP0/edit?slide=id.g244de45f28a_0_13#slide=id.g244de45f28a_0_13). The feedback from the TAG members was positive, with no objections or specific recommendations.

- [x] **All project metadata and resources are [vendor-neutral](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/).**

<!-- (TOC Evaluation goes here) --> 
The project fulfils the vendor-neutral criteria. The main communication channel are [Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C05BYHW1TNJ) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JA4rbcGzk7). Community meetings are held on [Zoom](https://github.com/microcks/community/blob/main/JOIN-OUR-MEETINGS.md), bi-weekly with US and APAC friendly timezones, which are showcased on the [CNCF calendar](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/microcks?view=month). Users are also capable of join [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/microcks/discussions) to follow up on the latest topics of interest for the project. 

The Microcks [website](https://microcks.io/) also follows the [CNCF guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/website-guidelines.md) to ensure neutrality, and offers a variety of social media platforms: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microcks/), [X](https://twitter.com/microcksio), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/microcks.io), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@microcksio), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Microcks), and other channels do not endorse any particular vendor.

- [x] **Review and acknowledgement of expectations for [Sandbox](sandbox.cncf.io) projects and requirements for moving forward through the CNCF Maturity levels.**		

<!-- (TOC Evaluation goes here) --> 
Met during Project's application on June 13, 2023, with its review available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4bU6A3RToc&t=2777s). 

Microcks Sandbox application can be found [[Sandbox] Microcks #37](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/37). The project maintainers have understood the expectations for Sandbox projects and requirements for moving forward through the CNCF incubation level.


- [x] **Due Diligence Review.**

Completion of this due diligence document, resolution of concerns raised, and presented for public comment satisfies the Due Diligence Review criteria.

- [x] **Additional documentation as appropriate for project type, e.g.: installation documentation, end user documentation, reference implementation and/or code samples.**

<!-- (TOC Evaluation goes here) --> 
The project documentation follows the [Diátaxis methodology](https://diataxis.fr/), and in 2024, maintainers undertook a six-month complete refactoring to enhance overall clarity and structure. The project maintainers have added the following additional documentation as follows.

- [Installation documentation](https://microcks.io/documentation/guides/installation/)
- [User documentation](https://microcks.io/documentation/guides/usage/)
- [Architecture documentation](https://microcks.io/documentation/overview/main-concepts/)
- [Blog posts from adopters and contributors](https://microcks.io/blog/)
- [Demos](https://github.com/orgs/microcks/repositories?q=demo)

Additionally, there are a number of guides and blogs from community members on technical and high-level topics, such as [How Microcks fit to unify inner and outer loops in cloud native](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-microcks-fit-unify-inner-outer-loops-cloud-native-kheddache/), [Traefik API Mocking On-Premises Setup](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik-hub/api-mocking/on-premises-setup), and [Bump.sh Mocking with Microcks](https://docs.bump.sh/guides/bump-sh-tutorials/mocking-with-microcks/).
