# k8gb - Governance Review - 2026-01-21

What follows is a governance review and assessment for the k8gb project. The
review was executed as part of due diligence when k8gb submitted to move to
Incubation level at CNCF in <https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1472>.

- Project: <https://github.com/k8gb-io/k8gb>
- Site: <https://www.k8gb.io/>
- Matriculation issue: <https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1472>
- Governance review issue: <https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1963>

This review is based on the template at
<https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/toc_subprojects/project-reviews-subproject/governance-review-template.md>

## Summary and Assessment

**Status:** Satisfactory

### Must-Fix Items

**The following issues have been identified that need to be resolved before
[project milestone or other requirement]:**

- The project must rename the API group for its CRDs from `k8gb.absa.oss`. This
  work is tracked in <https://github.com/k8gb-io/k8gb/issues/2180>.

### Points of Excellence

**The following aspects of governance are exemplary, and can be referenced as
examples for other projects to copy:**

- Meeting notes are conveniently discoverable in GitHub at
  [Project-Meeting-Notes.md](https://github.com/k8gb-io/k8gb/blob/master/Project-Meeting-Notes.md),
  and recordings are quickly published to YouTube.

### Areas for Improvement

**Over the next year, the project should work on the following issues to improve
its governance, these are considered non-blocking:**

- In the future, a GitHub issue should be created for election of each new maintainer.
- If there are people who make significant code contributions but not at the
  level of maintainers, consider an official "Contributor" role and listing to
  recognize and reward their contribution.

## Governance Summary

**The following review primarily consists of an audit on the project's
self-assessment in their matriculation application.**

### Governance Evolution

**Governance has continuously been iterated upon by the project as a result of
their experience applying it, with the governance history demonstrating
evolution of maturity alongside the project's maturity evolution.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Suggested

There has been little change to
[GOVERNANCE](https://github.com/k8gb-io/k8gb/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md) since it
was written several years ago. [CODEOWNERS
history](https://github.com/k8gb-io/k8gb/commits/master/CODEOWNERS) shows
onboarding and offboarding of maintainers.

### Discoverability

**Clear and discoverable project governance documentation.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

The project is all in one repo and that repo includes a
[GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/k8gb-io/k8gb/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md)
document.

### Accuracy and Clarity

**Governance is up to date with actual project activities, including any
meetings, elections, leadership, or approval processes.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Maintainers are listed in the repo's
[CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/k8gb-io/k8gb/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) doc, and
that document is actively updated when there are changes.

There is no record of an election accompanying the change.

Project meetings are held every other Wednesday as documented in
[Project-Meeting-Notes.md](https://github.com/k8gb-io/k8gb/blob/master/Project-Meeting-Notes.md)
and recordings and notes are published and linked there.

**Governance clearly documents [vendor-neutrality] of project direction.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Vendor neutrality is listed as a core principle of the project in
[GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/k8gb-io/k8gb/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md). The
project does not appear to be packaged and/or supported by major vendors. It was
originally created by [ABSA](https://www.absa.co.za/), a South African bank.

The project plans to move to a vendor-neutral API group in the future instead of
`k8gb.absa.oss`, see <https://github.com/k8gb-io/k8gb/issues/2180>.


### Decisions and Role Assignments

**Document how the project makes decisions on leadership roles, contribution
acceptance, requests to the CNCF, and changes to governance or project goals.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

The GOVERNANCE document states that all these decisions are made by a
supermajority of maintainers, who are those listed in CODEOWNERS.

**Document how role, function-based members, or sub-teams are assigned,
onboarded, and removed for specific teams (example: Security Response
Committee).**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

There is only one group of project leaders, the maintainers listed in
CODEOWNERS. According to the GOVERNANCE doc maintainers are added and removed by
an election of a supermajority of current maintainers, but there is no record of
previous elections.

There is no defined "contributor" role (other than maintainers), but all are
welcomed to submit Pull Requests through GitHub.

There are no additional teams other than the maintainers.

### Maintainers and Maintainer Lifecycle

**Document a complete maintainer lifecycle process (including roles, onboarding,
offboarding, and emeritus status).**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Maintainers are added to CODEOWNERS following a period of contributions to the
project, nomination and election in a GitHub issue. They are removed voluntarily
or per a supermajority vote of maintainers.

**Demonstrate usage of the maintainer lifecycle with outcomes, either through
the addition or replacement of maintainers as project events have required.**
