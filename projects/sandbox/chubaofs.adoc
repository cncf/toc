== ChubaoFS

*Name of project*: ChubaoFS

*Description*: ChuaboFS is a distributed file system designed for cloud native applications. ChubaoFS has several unique features that make it suitable for large-scale container platforms. For example, it has a general-purpose storage engine with scenario-aware replications to accommodate different file access patterns with optimized performance. In addition, it employs a separate cluster to store the file metadata in a distributed fashion with a simple but efficient metadata placement strategy. Moreover, it provides POSIX-compliant APIs with relaxed POSIX semantics and metadata atomicity to obtain better system performance.

*Statement on alignment with CNCF mission*: CNCF does not have any similar cloud native distributed file system solutions to the best of our knowledge. The ChubaoFS project itself aims at the use cases of applications/services deployed on Kubernetes (especially at a large scale) that need a persistent and reliable storage accessible like local disk. By providing the support of these use cases, ChubaoFS could make cloud native computing more ubiquitous based on our industrial experience.
