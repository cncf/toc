## Project Goal

The goal of LitmusChoas project is to provide infrastructure toolset to do end to end chaos engineering in Kubernetes environments, in a cloud-native way. By making the practice of chaos engineering easy in a highly scaled environment involving many applications, Litmus helps developers and SREs take control of reliability of the systems. Litmus is bringing application developers and users (SREs) together through chaos hub. Developers submit their chaos experiments in the CI environments to the hub and SREs bring the chaos experiments to the deployments or operations.

## Current Status

- **Project releases:** Litmus achieved GA status or 1.0 release in January 2020. Last latest release is 1.3. The project has made [21 releases](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/releases) so far.

- **Community status:** Litmus has monthly contributor calls. The community notes is [here](https://hackmd.io/a4Zu_sH4TZGeih-xCimi3Q). Other stats on  the community:

# Project Scope

## Clear project definition

The project aims to provide a chaos engineering framework - comprising of a chaos orchestrator, off-the-shelf chaos experiments for standard cloud native applications, and a central hub for forge collaboration between practitioners of chaos (SRE, DevOps engineers, Kubernetes developers). 

## Value-add to the CNCF ecosystem

*Does the project have a clear value add to the current project ecosystem? How does it relate to other projects with overlapping capabilities?*

Litmus adheres to the “Cloud Native” principles (as explained in this blog [here](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2019/11/06/cloud-native-chaos-engineering-enhancing-kubernetes-application-resiliency/)). In summary: 

- The life cycle management of Litmus happens using a chaos operator 
- Developer or SRE interacts with Litmus through declarative YAMLs. The chaos workflow can be completely automated in a highly scaled environment using GitOps
- Chaos-runner that manages each chaos job is in a container and can survive node reboots
- Any chaos logic which can run inside a container can be consumed through Litmus YAML files. So, anyone with a docker image that contains their chaos can make use of Litmus project to practice chaos engineering in their Kubernetes environment.


## Alignment with other CNCF projects

**Does the project align and actively collaborate with other CNCF projects?**

Litmus provides full-featured chaos experiments for most of the Kubernetes resources. Currently, there are eleven different generic ways to introduce and manage chaos on Kubernetes cluster. Apart from this through chaos hub, we bring application level chaos experients for other eco system projects such as CoreDNS, Kafka, OpenEBS. 
As part of its near-term roadmap, Litmus also is in the process of creating chaos charts for other sandbox/incubating/graduated CNCF projects. We are working with cncf-ci workgroup to include chaos stage in the CNCF projects. A PR is already in review for CoreDNS project.

Litmus chaos experiments are being extensively used as part of CI pipelines of the OpenEBS, a CNCF sandbox project that provides containerized storage solution for Kubernetes. Reference: https://openebs.ci/


**Does the project require any specific versions of projects (or APIs) to interoperate? (e.g. K8s API, CSI, CNI, CRI)?**

LitmusChaos mainly uses the Kubernetes API and also makes use of the Docker, Containerd APIs in case of some experiments.   

**Does the project augment or benefit other CNCF projects?**

The project benefits other CNCF projects by helping harden their resiliency under various deployment conditions. Chaos engineering for CNCF projects becomes easy.  

## Anticipated use cases

### Staging & Pre-Prod: Random Chaos:

- Gamedays:  The chaos experiments are typically executed in deployment environments hosting several microservices (either staging clusters that mimic production environments or production itself) as part of “Gamedays”, where a hypothesis is tested out, with the results either confirming the hypothesis and leading to fixes either in the infrastructure or the application software. 
- Continuous Chaos: Chaos experiments (as a background service) are continuously and randomly executed against production-like environments with the appropriate visualization and monitoring/observability setup to gauge system resilience against different chained failures, occurring at random instances.  

### CI/CD:

- Organizations can add "Kuberentes generic" and “application specific” chaos experiments as part of a “chaos stage” in their CI pipelines thereby enabling a left shift in improving fault tolerance and failure response. 

### Kubernetes Upgrade Testing:

- Kubernetes upgrades can cause changes in behaviour / response to component failures which can be exposed by performing chaos experiments against them.

### Chaos Engineering in production:
- Litmus plays important role to orchestrate chaos in production using GitOps.

# Other Considerations

## **Please note, these are not gating criteria but rather to:**

- **Collect a standard set of information for each project**
- **Provides a point in time capture of the state of the project which makes it easier to track progress at future reviews and / or promotion**
- **Help projects to prepare for SIG and TOC presentation**
- **Allow the SIG to review the project and perform due diligence for incubation**
- **Provide the TOC with the information required to accept sponsorship of a project and/or votes**
- **Identify and rectify any significant issues / blockers prior to presenting to the TOC and acceptance as a CNCF project**

## Cloud Native

**Does the project meet the definition of Cloud Native? The CNCF charter states:**

“Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.


“These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.”

Yes. This project meets the definition of Cloud Native.

## Project and Code Quality

**Are there any metrics around code quality? Are there good examples of code reviews? Are there enforced coding standards?**

- Some standards for the ansible-based experiments: https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
- Standards for go/python-based components (chaos-operator, chaos-runner) include: BCH, GoReportCard 
- CII best practice score of 82% is achieved. https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3202
- BCH score of 8/10 for litmuschaos/litmus and 10/10 for litmuschaos/loperator and litmuschaos/lexporter repositories.

Examples of review: 
  - https://github.com/litmuschaos/chaos-operator/pull/193
  - https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/pull/1015
  - https://github.com/litmuschaos/chaos-runner/pull/33
  - https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/pull/1345
  - https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus-e2e/pull/50

**What are the performance goals and results? What performance tradeoffs have been made? What is the resource cost?**

There are no performance tradeoffs. Litmus adopts a Kubernetes native approach to chaos with custom resources and controllers, 
thereby reusing the Kubernetes infrastructure itself, hence causing no additional resource costs. 

**What is the CI/CD system? Are there code coverage metrics? What types of tests exist?**

Apart from unit-tests, Litmus makes use of GinkGo based BDD framework to create e2e suites for testing the 
chaos framework (chaos experiments, operator, runner, exporter). These are executed via Gitlab pipelines at 
scheduled intervals, with Travis/CircleCI being used for “build” purposes. The build pipelines themselves include 
static code checks (lint) as well as security scans against the docker image artefacts before being pushed into the 
respective public image repositories on dockerhub. 

Code-Coverage has been added to the Chaos-Operator and the community is working on increasing the same via more 
unit-tests. 

**Is there documentation?**

Litmus has documentation explaining both user as well as developer workflows at the [litmus-docs](https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/) along with individual experiment guides.

**How is it deployed?**

The Litmus chaos operator is installed as a K8s deployment, along with the custom resource definitions (CRDs) for the ChaosEngine, ChaosExperiment and ChaosResult resources. The out-of-the-box chaos experiments are installed as CustomResource YAML manifests. 

**How is it orchestrated?**

Orchestrated by Kubernetes natively. Litmus has a chaos-runner that runs in a container, an operator that is built using the operator-sdk and chaos experiments which are defined as Kubernetes custom resources.


**How will the project benefit from acceptance into the CNCF?**

- This project will have a vendor neutral home. The project will generate interest in many CNCF project members to contribute application level chaos experiments to the chaos hub when it is accepted into CNCF.
- CNCF projects themselves may adopt Litmus more activly when accepted into CNCF.

**Has a security assessment by the security SIG been done? If not, what is the status/progress of the assessment?**

No. We have to approach the security SIG.

# Promotion to Incubation

## Open Governance

**How are committers chosen?**

- Committers are chosen once they make significant contributions (such as additions of new chaos charts/categories, 
litmus backend/chaos orchestration component improvements, or litmus project infra improvements such as docusaurus-based
website, chaoshub) and are committed to the long-term success of the project. 

**How are architectural and roadmap decisions made?**

- Roadmap & architectural decisions are made via consultation and feedback from the Litmus community (users and contributors) 
comprising developers and SREs. The feedback is received via github issues or during the monthly community sync up call.
- ROADMAP items are reviewed by maintainers before acceptance. 

**How many decision makers are outside the sponsoring organization.**
