== OpenMetrics

*Name of project:* OpenMetrics

*Description:*

OpenMetrics refines the Prometheus exposition format into an independent standard.

Prometheus has become the de facto standard in cloud-native metric monitoring, and has active upstream work by competitors.
The ease of implementing this exposition data has led to an explosion in compatible metrics endpoints with 300+ exporters registered, dozens of native integrations, and unknown numbers of internal adoptions.

To allow for even more adoption, OpenMetrics received a lot of additional scrutiny and engineering time from several large players in the cloud-native space.
It also puts the format under a neutral name, allowing more monitoring vendors to adopt it without potential political considerations.

With substantial commitments for adoption, OpenMetrics will enjoy solid support from day 1.
Amongst others, these are:

* Prometheus
* Cloudflare
* GitLab
* Google
* Grafana
* InfluxData
* Oath.com
* RobustPerception
* SpaceNet
* Uber

OpenMetrics was presented at the [CNCF TOC meeting on 2018-06-19](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ym8fLRCaX43uHPHBRyuRXM62U8m4vXaBXkuUp6tt3js/edit#slide=id.g25ca91f87f_0_0).

*Statement on alignment with CNCF mission:*

Given the CNCF's stated role in "fostering the growth and evolution of the ecosystem" and "making the technology accessible and reliable", we believe OpenMetrics helps with both of these goals.
