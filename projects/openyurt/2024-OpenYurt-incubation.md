# OpenYurt Incubation Due Diligence

- Link to [Incubation application issue](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/797)

<!-- This template provides the TOC with the outline for completing due diligence of a project to move levels. This universal template is designed to capture all criteria so the TOC may ensure prior level criteria do not regress. As part of completing the due diligence, the TOC member should update the template to convey the level the project applied for the criteria by bolding the level indicated where the criteria is relevant. -->

## Incubation Evaluation Summary for OpenYurt

### Criteria Evaluation

[Ricardo Rocha](https://github.com/rochaporto) conducted both due diligence and adopter interviews for Incubation. The project has completed the criteria that shows its maturity at the applied level.

The TOC would like to highlight some areas from the project review:
* OpenYurt has an active and diverse community, and adopters have highlighted this as one of its main strengths
* Its architecture extends instead of replacing existing core components in Kubernetes. This is an approach that differentiates it from other solutions in the ecosystem and that was also highlighted as a key strength by adopters
* The governance and contributors guides are well defined but were last updated over 3 years ago. The TOC suggests a review together with TAG Contributor Strategy to consider if improvements can be made to the current member roles and contributor ladder

The following required incubation items were raised and implemented by the project during the review period:
* A security self assessment following the template from TAG-Security
* Setting up of the best practices badge from the OpenSSF

Other items suggested for incubation were taken as issues in the project and have also been followed up:
* Documenting integrations with other CNCF and non-CNCF projects to facilitate adoption by end users
* Documenting the process for definition of the project roadmap
* Clarification of public contact for security vulnerability reports

### Adoption Evaluation

The adopter interviews showed project usage at a level compatible with CNCF incubation. Adopters integrate OpenYurt for management of edge devices on a variety of use cases, and highlight its extensibility of upstream vanilla Kubernetes as one of its key strengths - some adopters highlighted this is a differentiating point when compared to similar projects in the ecosystem which do the same by replacing some of the core components in Kubernetes. The project has a well established and responsive community in a variety of communication channels.

Adopters also suggested improvements in resource consumption, multi-tenancy support and recommend the project focuses on edge AI use cases looking forward.

### Final Assessment

The TOC has found the project to have satisfied the criteria for Incubation.

- [x] **TAG provides insight/recommendation of the project in the context of the landscape**

OpenYurt is a Kubernetes-native project designed to seamlessly extend Kubernetes capabilities to cloud-edge environments, addressing critical needs in IoT, industrial automation, and other edge-intensive domains. Its architecture employs CRDs, NodePools for regional edge node management, and local caching mechanisms to ensure reliability and offline functionality in low-connectivity scenarios. With tools like Helm for installation and yurtadm for managing edge components, OpenYurt provides a user-friendly, modular approach to deploying Kubernetes across distributed edge regions. Its alignment with CNCF principles is evident in its extensibility, cloud-native design, and focus on enabling Kubernetes to manage diverse workloads across geographically dispersed environments.

During CNCF incubation, OpenYurt must provide evidence of API stability, scalability benchmarks, and fault tolerance in production-grade deployments. Expanding community engagement, demonstrating governance maturity, and showcasing broader adoption across industries will further validate its readiness. Additionally, improved documentation, including comparisons with similar projects like KubeEdge and an articulated roadmap for the next 12â€“24 months, will solidify its position as a leading solution for cloud-edge orchestration. With these enhancements, OpenYurt is well-positioned to drive innovation in distributed Kubernetes architectures and make a meaningful impact in the CNCF ecosystem.

The CNCF TAG-Runtime recommends OpenYurt for incubation, recognizing its strong alignment with cloud native principles and its potential to address critical challenges in cloud-edge orchestration. With its Kubernetes-native design, extensibility, and growing community, OpenYurt is well-positioned to impact the CNCF ecosystem as it matures significantly.

#### Adoption

##### Adopter 1 - Information Technology

Adopter 1 is a senior software engineer working in the area of edge computing.

###### Usage

Adopter 1 reports interest in the project started in 2020 with adoption in 2021. OpenYurt is integrated with multiple solutions at the company which are then packaged and made available to end users.

Adopter 1 reported integration with the company's existing edge computing platform, filling the role of managing edge devices. Examples of usage include switching off edge devices during the night and bringing them back in the morning; AI on the edge for object recognition, including car plate recognition at parking lots and similar usage in retail and restaurants.

###### Perception and Feeling

Adopter 1 participates actively in the development of the project and has dedicated developers for this task. Those developers are active in regular meetings.

Interaction with the project happens mostly via GitHub issues, with TikTok and WeChat also used to interact with the community.

###### Strengths and Improvements

Adopter 1 seeds the added networking stability to standard kubernetes as one of the main strengths, particularly important for edge workloads. The additional primitive for managing `nodepools` is also a valuable addition to the standard `daemonset` and `deployment`.

Adopter 1 sees installation as the main pain point and sees the same happening with other end users. No single installation method is ideal, leading to distinct methods depending on the use case.

Adopter 1 sees improvements can come with better support for AI workloads, especially for inference but also including the usage of remote devices for distributed training. Adopter 1 sees this as an opportunity for OpenYurt to pioneer this type of workload.

##### Adopter 2 - Telecommunications

Adopter 2 is a project manager in the cloud computing area, working at the innovation center of a large telecommunications company.

###### Usage

Adopter 2 has been using OpenYurt since 2023, performing regular updates twice a month. The project is fully integrated with their kubernetes facilities, allowing a single installation method for third party applications focusing on validation and certification of edge devices. Adopter 2 relies on OpenYurt to analyse videos from cameras

Adopter 2 considered other solutions, having decided to use OpenYurt as it adds functionality on top instead of changing Kubernetes.

###### Perception and Feeling

Adopter 2 is an active participant in community meetings for the project every 2 weeks. They also contribute code back to the community, fixing issues with static analysis tooling.

Adopter 2 mainly communicates with the community via WeChat, but also uses GitHub and the regular community meetings.

###### Strengths and Improvements

Adopter 2 sees the automated development capabilities as a way of greatly simplifying development of edge node applications. They also see the simplified operations as a main strength, with simplified installation methods for those remote devices in particular for third party applications.

Adopter 2 would like to see better multi-tenancy support, including tenant separation.

##### Adopter 3 - Financial and Industrial Services

Adopter 3 is an engineer working on Kubernetes for over 4 years and responsible for cloud edge products for over 2 years, in close contact with the OpenYurt project. Adopter 3 is responsible for financial and industrial products.

###### Usage

Adopter 3 chose OpenYurt as it extends existing vanilla kubernetes deployments, allowing for an edge solution that is compatible with existing clusters. This gave a solution that is less intrusive than other projects such as KubeEdge.

Adopter 3 runs OpenYurt for production workloads in multiple deployments, including a major electricity provider in China as well as smaller providers around the country. This includes the monitoring of 1000s of electricity sub-stations, with a setup where OpenYurt is deployed along KubeVirt. This solutions has been in place for almost 2 years.

Adopter 3 follows the upstream releases closely.

Adopter 3 is looking to extending its usage of the project to improve connectivity between edge devices, as well as improved isolation and better network stability. They expect this will open usage to other use cases, including automotive and drones.

Adopter 3's main contributions to the project have been in the area of bandwidth usage optimization and reduction of packet loss, as well as security enhancements in the area of encryption.

###### Perception and Feeling

Adopter 3 mainly communicates with the project via DingTalk. They can see maintainers review open issues weekly, with discussions on both issues and roadmap.

Adopter 3 has been invited multiple times to present their use cases, and follows presentations from other users as well. They see it as a very active community.

###### Strengths and Improvements

Adopter 3 recently made a comparison with KubeEdge. This comparison showed OpenYurt has a higher overall resource consumption likely to the existing of explicit nodes on the edge as it follows the native kubernetes deployments. Reducing this numbers would open up new use cases where resource usage is particularly important.

Adopter 3 recommends the project follows this particular topic looking forward.

##### Adopter 4 - Research

Adopter 4 is a software engineer at a research laboratory and currently a OpenYurt maintainer.

###### Usage

Adopter 4 relies on OpenYurt for research work in the area of scheduling optimization on edge environments. Adopter 4 focuses in particular on the integration with other projects such as Istio, and adds features to the project where appropriate and needed.

Adopter 4 also works together with other end users helping them integrate the tools in their environments.

###### Perception and Feeling

Adopter 4 mainly relies on DingTalk but also Slack to communicate with the project's community. Adopter 4 also actively participates helping other end users. They see very good interactions with other maintainers in the project, where GitHub is the main communication channel.

Adopter 4 joins the weekly meetings when required or when the topic is interesting.

###### Strengths and Improvements

Adopter 4 also has members working on KubeEdge. OpenYurt's main attraction is being less intrusive to the upstream kubernetes components, giving the example that the upstream kubelet is used without any modification.

Adopter 4 thinks the project could become more popular and should focus on attracting new users. It also recommends focusing on further integration with AI tools in particular EdgeAI modules for inference.

Adopter 4 also suggest network usage should be a key focus area, reducing the traffic in the underlay network to minimize the impact on slow network deployments.
