# KubeEdge Graduation Proposal

Since becoming a CNCF incubation-level project in September 2020, the KubeEdge project has made significant progress in developing contributors and users. In the past few years, the project also **helps the cloud native ecosystem to expand to more industries outside the data center**, and has been widely used in various new fields such as Smart CDN, Smart Campus, Intelligent Transpiration, Vehicle, Aerospace, Smart logistics, Financial, Blockchain and other fields. On behalf of KubeEdge team, we believe that KubeEdge is ready for graduation.

## Background

KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at the edge. It's built upon Kubernetes and provides fundamental infrastructure support for networking, application deployment and metadata synchronization between cloud and edge. In addition, KubeEdge supports MQTT, allowing developers to design logic and enable resource constraints for device communications at the edge. KubeEdge decouples and simplifies Kubernetes modules.

![KubeEdge Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/26f47ccdb47b4fcd3c6eef9a7d97dffa49d619be/docs/images/kubeedge_arch.png)

It aims to resolve three major challenges for edge computing: 1) network reliability and bandwidth limit between cloud and edge, 2) resource constraint at edge, 3) highly distributed and heterogeneous device management.

KubeEdge provides:

1. **Seamless Cloud-Edge Communication** for both metadata and data
2. **Edge Autonomy**: Autonomous operation of Edge even when disconnected from cloud.
3. **Low Resource Requirement**: KubeEdge can work in constrained resource situations (low memory, low bandwidth, low compute)
4. **Simplified Device Communication**: Easy communication between applications and devices for IOT and Industrial Internet of Things (_IIoT_)
5. **Service discovery and traffic proxy** for edge application

In addition to these basic capabilities, the community is constantly exploring new directions for edge scenarios, including:

1. **Edge-cloud synergy AI**, Sedna subproject implement across edge-cloud collaborative training and collaborative inference capabilities, such as joint inference, incremental learning, federated learning, and lifelong learning. Sedna supports popular AI frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Pytorch, PaddlePaddle, MindSpore.
2. **Edge-Cloud synergy robots**, based on KubeEdge, to implement cloud robot platform, to integrate cloud computing technologies(cloud native, AI, storage etc) with robots, to support heterogeneous robots, including mobile robots, robotics arm, and many other robot platforms.

## Alignment with Cloud Native

KubeEdge falls in the scope of [CNCF Runtime TAG](https://github.com/cncf/sig-runtime), and is also well-aligned with the CNCF's mission to make cloud native computing ubiquitous.

### Value-add to the CNCF ecosystem

As the CNCF's first cloud-native edge computing framework and incubation project, KubeEdge has helped **expanding cloud native ecosystem to more industries outside the data center**, including Smart CDN, Smart Campus, Intelligent Transpiration, Vehicle, Aerospace, Smart logistics, Financial, Blockchain and other fields.

- Building an open edge computing platform with cloud native technologies to **extend the boundary of cloud native**
- Helping users extending their business architecture, applications, services, etc. from cloud to edge in same experience
- Implementing extensible cloud-edge architecture based on Kubernetes
- Seamless development, deployment and execution of complex workloads at edge with optimized resources

### Alignment with other CNCF projects

As a CNCF project, KubeEdge integrates with the CNCF landscape and is built on top of the following CNCF projects and brings them to edge computing.

- Kubernetes: KubeEdge built on Kubernetes, compatible with native Kubernetes APIs and allows calls to these native APIs to manage edge nodes and devices.
- containerd, cri-o: KubeEdge supports run containers in edge node with containerd, cri-o though CRI.
- Prometheus: KubeEdge provides Prometheus metrics to monitor edge nodes and edge applications.
- WasmEdge: KubeEdge supports run lightweight wasm applications on edgenode with WasmEdge.
- KubeFlow: KubeEdge integrates with Kubeflow to run AI Jobs on edge nodes.
- ArgoCD: KubeEdge integrates with ArgoCD to provide GitOps on the edge.

In the future, we are planning to expand these integrations including edge service mesh with Istio and Envoy, edge storage with CSI related projects, edge serverless with Knative, OpenFunction, etc.
