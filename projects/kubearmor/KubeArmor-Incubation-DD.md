# KubeArmor Incubation Due Diligence

- Link to [Incubation application issue](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1326)

<!-- This template provides the TOC with the outline for completing due diligence of a project to move levels. This universal template is designed to capture all criteria so the TOC may ensure prior level criteria do not regress. As part of completing the due diligence, the TOC member should update the template to convey the level the project applied for the criteria by bolding the level indicated where the criteria is relevant. -->

## Incubation Evaluation Summary for KubeArmor

### Criteria Evaluation

@TheFoxAtWork conducted the due diligence of KubeArmor who applied for Incubation. The project has not completed the criteria that show its maturity at Incubation. 

### Adoption Evaluation

The adopter interviews reflect a project too early for the level which the project applied. The adopter interviews conducted did not demonstrate sufficient adoption and use of the project, adopters submitted for interview must have a current implementation of the project in at least dev/int/staging and at least one adopter must have the project in production for incubation level not in a manner that resells the open source project to an adopter-by-proxy (i.e. Marketplace provides instances of open source projects where the marketplace is the adopter submitted for interview). Only one adopter met this criteria.

### Final Assessment

The KubeArmor project remains an innovative approach to not only configure but enforce cloud native security in Kubernetes environments. While the project features, capabilities, and operation are what adopters desire and addresses many (but not all) of their needs, the governing and operational aspects of the project do not match the level of maturity of the project's the technical design and execution.

The TOC's evaluation of the project shows a needed focus to complete the outstanding blockers and reapply when the following conditions are met:

* All project metadata and resources are [vendor-neutral](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/) - Separate the project from AccuKnox and review all code, docs, groups, and other project assets to confirm separation and neutrality.
  * Review and acknowledgement of expectations for [Sandbox](sandbox.cncf.io) projects and requirements for moving forward through the CNCF Maturity levels - Will be met when the above is resolved.
* Code and Doc ownership in Github and elsewhere matches documented governance roles - update the project governance, codeowners, and maintainers files to ensure code and doc ownership are consistent and enforced in accordance with the documented governance of the project.
* Document agreement that project will adopt CNCF Code of Conduct - adopt the CNCF code of conduct.
* All subprojects, if any, are listed - There are some project repos that indicate a specialty sub-project (such as the policy-templates) which detail being "commuity-owned" but do not consider any additional governance or documentation associated with how they are maintained beyond annotation that it is an initiative from AccuKnox. This needs decoupled to provide clear separation between the Project, its Community, and the donating company. Improve the documentation so it is explicit to adopters what repos and efforts are sub-projects and how they are governed in relation to the main project.
* Document the project's release process - Document the release process for the project.
* Enforcing Access Control Rules to secure the code base against attacks (Example: two factor authentication enforcement, and/or use of ACL tools.) - Review the security guidelines against current project permissions. Verify secure repo configuration. Resolve conflicts with Scorecards reporting regarding branch protection. Update maintainers governance to indicate access control requirements.
* Document assignment of security response roles and how reports are handled - cease use of the support @ accuknox email for reporting security vulnerabilities, in favor of the native Security vulnerability reporting feature in GitHub and establish a dedicated mailing alias for the project security team.  The project is further recommended to establish a project security response committee made up of maintainters and contributors with security expertise.
* Used in appropriate capacity by at least 3 independent + indirect/direct adopters - work with community members to identify additional direct adopters using the project in a production capacity. The available adopters were primarily using the project in staging or dev (early adoption) or did not have substantial adoption of the project within their environment to adequately convey the value of integrating it into their environment.

## Application Process Principles

### Suggested

N/A

### Required

- [X] **Give a presentation and engage with the domain specific TAG(s) to increase awareness**

This was completed within TAG Security's Policy Working Group and occurred on 09 JUN 2021, the recording can be discovered at https://youtu.be/W8PlIBXT1hA?si=nJZ5k9rlRcHFDjHp.

A second presentation was delivered on 09 OCT 2024, the recording can be discovered at 


- [X] **TAG provides insight/recommendation of the project in the context of the landscape**

The TAG provided the following recommendation on the [presentation issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues/1372#issuecomment-2403861372):
> The project has seen significant growth and adoption since the original acceptance to Sandbox. Having conducted threat modeling and implemented a number of static analysis and security processes in the development lifecycle provides a healthy project stance for security.

- [ ] **All project metadata and resources are [vendor-neutral](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/).**

The project's site does not explicitly convey vendor neutrality. The donating company's logo and statement of creation occurs at least twice on the home page. There is no mention of vendor neutrality or open source on the main site. The blogs heading on the site states "open source solutions for kubernetes security" but can easily be interpreted that KubeArmor is not open source. The only reference to Cloud Native is the community group link in the site header. Further, the inclusion of modelarmor on the kubearmor site directs users to accuknox but is listed on kubearmor's site as "open source". ModelArmor is in the KubeArmor org repo.  The project lacks web separation to ensure neutrality.

Additionally, there are several references to AccuKnox, owning, initiating, or driving aspects of KubeArmor that need reconciled for the project to be considered vendor neutral. The [Policy-templates repo](https://github.com/kubearmor/policy-templates?tab=readme-ov-file#-contributions) is one such example where, in addition to the reference of AccuKnox driven initiative, also shows a dependency with [AccuKnox's travis-ci for KubeArmor](https://github.com/kubearmor/policy-templates/blob/c955043c5d16b6935e45a7b14e123fc14e80e9ac/README.md?plain=1#L4).

- [ ] **Review and acknowledgement of expectations for [Sandbox](sandbox.cncf.io) projects and requirements for moving forward through the CNCF Maturity levels.**		
- While the project was onboarded on 16-NOV-2021, the KubeArmor security group is email address for `support@accuknox.com` persists and does not provide separation between the business/product/service, and the project (requirement for sandbox)

- [ ] **Due Diligence Review.**

Completion of this due diligence document, resolution of concerns raised, and presented for public comment satisifies the Due Diligence Review criteria.

- [X] **Additional documentation as appropriate for project type, e.g.: installation documentation, end user documentation, reference implementation and/or code samples.**

The KubeArmor project has a variety of documentation to assist adopters and developers, as well as contributors, working with the project. The Documentation is clearly divided in to discoverable headers, with distinction on use cases from the overall project docs and guides.

## Governance and Maintainers

Note: this section may be augmented by the completion of a Governance Review from TAG Contributor Strategy.

### Suggested

- [ ] **Clear and discoverable project governance documentation.**

The Project's governance is kept in their primary repo for the project but is not linked from the Readme or on the project docs. While discoverable and clear, the governance does not cover considerations like inactivity of a maintainer. It also indicates an "as-needed" basis for inviting new maintainers to the project but does not specifiy what those needs are. This may place the project in an unhealthy posture in the future if not proactive defining its maintainership needs and building a succession of future maintainers from its active contributor pool.

Recommend the project include a link to governance in the Readme as well as in the project docs so adopters and contributors better understand the governance model of the project as community-driven. Also recommend the project define as-needed and consult with contributor strategy to build diveristy of its maintainers through its governance.

- [ ] **Governance has continuously been iterated upon by the project as a result of their experience applying it, with the governance history demonstrating evolution of maturity alongside the project's maturity evolution.**

The Project's goverance has only received [one update](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/commit/3fe550b02af2b2eba9de0efecafc8b86d678501e) since creation, and does not reflect iterative improvements by application of governance. 

- [ ] **Governance is up to date with actual project activities, including any meetings, elections, leadership, or approval processes.**

The Project's governance does not contain sufficient information to validate its governance activities and the repository does not have any activities to reflect exercising their [described process to become a maintainer](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/blob/30345613e48533ec00732e2e7a0382058e04b83b/GOVERNANCE.md?plain=1#L22).

- [ ] **Governance clearly documents [vendor-neutral](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/) of project direction.**

The Project's governance does not include any references to neutrality and does not provide any guidance regarding neutrality for the Project's blog and website. It has been confirmed that the project's website DOES include a link for ModelArmor which takes users to Accuknox's website and is considered in conflict with CNCF's requirements for vendor neutrality. It is noted that the KubeArmor security group is email address for `support@accuknox.com` which does not meet expectations for neutrality and does not provide separation between the business/product/service, and the project (requirement for sandbox).

- [ ] **Document how the project makes decisions on leadership, contribution acceptance, requests to the CNCF, and changes to governance or project goals.**

The Project's governance references the process by which maintainers are nominated and confirmed. The project's contribution guide does not define how criteria for contributions to be accepted, but does provide enough information (such as DCO requirement) that it could be inferred. There is no information regarding how the project may make requests of the CNCF or how it makes changes to its governance or project goals (project-level decision making).

- [ ] **Document how role, function-based members, or sub-teams are assigned, onboarded, and removed for specific teams (example: Security Response Committee).**

The Project does not have any documentation regarding assignment, onboarding, and removal of specific role of function-based members and teams.

- [ ] **Document a complete maintainer lifecycle process (including roles, onboarding, offboarding, and emeritus status).**

The Project does not have any documentation regarding the maintainer lifecycle process.

- [ ] **Demonstrate usage of the maintainer lifecycle with outcomes, either through the addition or replacement of maintainers as project events have required.**

Given there is no documentation regarding the maintainer lifecycle process, nothing can be demonstrated.

- [X] **If the project has subprojects: subproject leadership, contribution, maturity status documented, including add/remove process.**

The project does not appear to have any subprojects at the time of application for incubation.

### Required

- [X] **Document complete list of current maintainers, including names, contact information, domain of responsibility, and affiliation.**

The Project's maintainer list includes eight maintainers, 4 from AccuKnox, 2 from CERN, 1 from Dankook University, and another identified as independent. Maintainers listed include links to their GitHub profiles. No domain of responsibility is defined as the project is small enough the project's other repos are considered are joint responsibilities. As the project continues to grow, this will change.

- [X] **A number of active maintainers which is appropriate to the size and scope of the project.**

Yes, for now but without changes to its operations the project may become unhealthy (victim of its own success). The project has eight maintainers, of which at least two are regularly active. The project's current backlog of PRs (91 including fix(deps)) and open issues (155) as of March 2025 suggest that the current activity is slowing down on the project and there will need to be a focused effort by the project to onboard new maintainers (moving contributors to maintainers, formalizing that governance more), re-activate current maintainers, and generally continue to make progress on the project in driving down the open issues and PRs against their defined roadmap.

- [ ] **Code and Doc ownership in Github and elsewhere matches documented governance roles.**

The project does not have documented roles beyond maintainers listed however the CODEOWNERS file calls out three default reviewers (indicating a new role which needs documented) and does not define process to add new individuals to this role. One individual defined in the CODEOWNERS is not listed as a maintainer and they appear to no longer be active in the project as of March 2024.

- [ ] **Document agreement that project will adopt CNCF Code of Conduct.**

The project has adopted a separate code of conduct that is modified beyond the CNCF CoC, and the current link to the CNCF CoC is broken (indicating an older version was used). The KubeArmor CoC does include reporting information specific to the project. 

The project needs to adopt the CNCF CoC and may add provisions above and beyond what the CNCF CoC details, and is encouraged to maintain reporting information with a mechanism for reporting in the event the complaint is against one of the maintainers. The CoC needs to also link to those maintainers so reporters know who to contact.

- [X] **CNCF Code of Conduct is cross-linked from other governance documents.**

The Project's Governance links to their current CoC file, last updated 4 years ago.

- [ ] **All subprojects, if any, are listed.**

The project does not define sub-projects and does not have a component/repo construct to assist adopters in understanding what is in scope of KubeArmor. There are some project repos that indicate a specialty sub-project (such as the policy-templates) which detail being "commuity-owned" but do not consider any additional governance or documentation associated with how they are maintained beyond annotation that it is an initiative from AccuKnox. This needs decoupled to provide clear separation between the Project, its Community, and the donating company. 

## Contributors and Community

Note: this section may be augmented by the completion of a Governance Review from TAG Contributor Strategy.

### Suggested

- [ ] **Contributor ladder with multiple roles for contributors.**

The project has not defined a contributor ladder.

### Required

- [X] **Clearly defined and discoverable process to submit issues or changes.**

KubeArmor's Contributing.md file includes a link to create a new issue within the project and a link to identify good-first-issues for new contributors to pick up. 

- [X] **Project must have, and document, at least one public communications channel for users and/or contributors.**

The project's README includes a link to the KubeArmor slack channel in the CNCF slack workspace.

- [X] **List and document all project communication channels, including subprojects (mail list/slack/etc.).  List any non-public communications channels and what their special purpose is.**

The project's README provides links and information on public communication channels, with the exception of the AccuKnox security mailing list the project is currently using for reporting security vulnerabilities (this needs moved to a project managed list and not a vendor list).

- [X] **Up-to-date public meeting schedulers and/or integration with CNCF calendar.**

The project's README provides a link to its community meeting call and notes, with Google Calendar and ICS meeting invites as well.

- [X] **Documentation of how to contribute, with increasing detail as the project matures.**

The project includes a CONTRIBUTING.md and an additional file for first time contributors to open source that details how to set up a contributing fork for KubeArmor. The README also links to a development guide and testing guide to further support contributors.

- [X] **Demonstrate contributor activity and recruitment.**

The project has previously participated in Google Summer of code as well as LFX mentoring (term 3 cited in meeting notes). They've also held at least 1 live stream and actively engage potential contributors.

## Engineering Principles

### Suggested

- [ ] **Roadmap change process is documented.**

The project manages its roadmap through GitHub projects, but does not currently have any documentation around how features, bugs, and changes are added, introduced, and managed in the project board.

- [ ] **History of regular, quality releases.**

The project cuts stable releases approximately twice annualy but does not provide documentation or clarity on checks and tests that detail quality expectations. Release notes are available but don't consistently or readily convey what changes were introduced without in depth analysis into each PR or commit.

### Required 

- [X] **Document project goals and objectives that illustrate the project’s differentiation in the Cloud Native landscape as well as outlines how this project fulfills an outstanding need and/or solves a problem differently.**

The project's README provides an overview of how it works in addition to the introductory information about what it does and the focus areas for the project (infra hardening, least permissions, application behavior enforcement, and multiple deployment types supported). It also provides a differentiation.md file which contains more detail about the types of mitigations it provides, attack mitigations, and challenges with traditional detection tooling in cloud native environments.

- [X] **Document what the project does, and why it does it - including viable cloud native use cases.**

The differentiation file has a significant amount of information to address the what and why. However the project does not detail its use cases clearly.  The [documentation link to use cases](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/commit/ff0baab25ed1506becd359efc04e2825bb9d835c) directs users to the hardening.md file which DOES detail the various types of specific uses for the project, how it works, the attack scenario it addresses, corresponding control mappings, and the policy used to address the use case.

The use case information on the project website itself is different than what is contained in the repo; the repo only touches on hardening whereas the site includes least permissions, app behavior, and "advanced" which provides additional usecases that are covered in the repo's "hardening.md" file.

It is recommended the project review and restructure its use cases to be consistent between both the repo and website.

- [X] **Document and maintain a public roadmap or other forward looking planning document or tracking mechanism.**

The project uses GitHub Projects as its public roadmap, for which several exist including a [Backlog/Roadmap project board.](https://github.com/orgs/kubearmor/projects/9)

- [X] **Document overview of project architecture and software design that demonstrates viable cloud native use cases, as part of the project's documentation.**

The project's differnetiation file contains sufficient information on the project architecture and design to demonstrate cloud native use cases.  The use cases file also contains cloud native specifics.

- [ ] **Document the project's release process.**

The project does not appear to have documented their release process.

## Security

Note: this section may be augemented by a joint-assessment performed by TAG Security.

### Suggested

N/A

### Required

- [X] **Clearly defined and discoverable process to report security issues.**

The project has defined their process for reporting security issues in the [security.md file](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/commit/ee7d4957548658e230f619e3bd7e1125b6e08c7f), readily discoverable through the GitHub UI.

- [ ] **Enforcing Access Control Rules to secure the code base against attacks (Example: two factor authentication enforcement, and/or use of ACL tools.)**

The project does not appear to have any public facing information regarding how it enforces access control against its codebase. A review of the OpenSSF Scorecard for the project appears to indicate, minimally, that branch protection is not adequate for the project:

> **Reason**
```
branch protection is not maximal on development and all release branches
```

> **Details**
```
Info: 'allow deletion' disabled on branch 'main'
Info: 'force pushes' disabled on branch 'main'
Info: 'branch protection settings apply to administrators' is required to merge on branch 'main'
Info: 'stale review dismissal' is required to merge on branch 'main'
Info: required approving review count is 2 on branch 'main'
Info: codeowner review is required on branch 'main'
Warn: 'last push approval' is disabled on branch 'main'
Info: 'up-to-date branches' is required to merge on branch 'main'
Info: status check found to merge onto on branch 'main'
Info: PRs are required in order to make changes on branch 'main'
```

It is worth noting that Scorecard can be inaccurate and it is recommended the project review the scorecard documentation to ensure accurate reporting and corrections to permissions are made. A sampling of closed Pull Requests has identified several for which no review was required or conducted prior to merge, although these do not occur 2024 onward in the project.

It is recommended the project review the security recommendations for projects, particularly those on [access management](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/security/security-guidelines/#11-access-management) to confirm appropriate settings.

- [ ] **Document assignment of security response roles and how reports are handled.**

The project does not have documentation regarding security response roles. It does have information on how reports are handled within their security.md file ([steps 2 and 3](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/security#please-use-the-below-process-to-report-a-vulnerability-to-the-project)). The security.md file seems to imply at least 3 distinct entities involved in the the security response process:

* A commerical entity - AccuKnox; indicating the project is not vendor neutral. Responsible for receiving vulnerability reports.
* A project security team; unknown composition and assignment. Responsible for providing an initial response and fixing the vulnerability
* A project maintainter; only engaged when breadth, scope, recreation, and confirmation are not readily apparent based on the initial report received by AccuKnox.

It is recommended the project cease use of the `support@accuknox.com` email for reporting security vulnerabilities, in favor of the native Security vulnerability reporting feature in GitHub and establish a dedicated mailing alias for the project security team.  The project is further recommended to establish a project security response committee made up of maintainters and contributors with security expertise. The Kubernetes Security Response Committee is an excellent example of such a group and includes detailed information for [onboarding and offboarding](https://github.com/kubernetes/committee-security-response/blob/main/src-onboarding-offboarding.md) in addition to [robust information regarding membership on the committee.](https://github.com/kubernetes/committee-security-response/blob/main/security-release-process.md#security-response-committee-membership)

- [X] **Document Security Self-Assessment.**

As of this writing, [the project provided its self-assessment and it is currently pending changes request prior to approval and merging.](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/pull/1430)

- [X] **Achieve the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices passing badge.**

The project currently has an [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge of Passing.](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/5401#all) 

## Ecosystem

### Suggested

N/A

### Required

- [X] **Publicly documented list of adopters, which may indicate their adoption level (dev/trialing, prod, etc.)**

The project has a [list of adopters](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/commit/ebfee6073776b0c6d523a651e257bf856ca80a11) public on their repository. Many security projects experience challenges in listing adopters due to security concerns of exposure, which explains the brevity in the list. The project was able to provide a number of additional adopters for the purposes of interview scheduling.

- [ ] **Used in appropriate capacity by at least 3 independent + indirect/direct adopters, (these are not required to be in the publicly documented list of adopters)**

Of the four adopter interviews conducted, only one met the requirement of a direct adopter (but did not provide approval for publishing yet). The two of the adopters did not have sufficient internal adoptions to demonstrate appropriate capacity.

The project provided the TOC with a list of adopters for verification of use of the project at the level expected, i.e. production use for graduation, dev/test for incubation with increasing production use.

The project provided additional adopters over the course of the Due Diligence, however many were unresponsive.

- [ ] **TOC verification of adopters.**

The TOC Sponsor for the project was able to verify use of the project by three of the four provided adopters, the remaining adopter was unable to provide timely or relevent experience within thier organization to convey appropriate capacity and is therefore not included within this Due Diligence. The information provided by this adopter was largely speculative, having not been involved in the adoption of the project beyond an initial proof of concept.

Refer to the Adoption portion of this document for more information.

- [X] **Clearly documented integrations and/or compatibility with other CNCF projects as well as non-CNCF projects.**

The project's architecture overview identifies other projects it is compatible with and makes use of (largely LSMs and eBPF). The project does list potential use with OpenTelemetry and does list [a support matrix for Linux distros and cloud service providers (CSPs) Kubernetes offerings](https://docs.kubearmor.io/kubearmor/quick-links/support_matrix).

#### Adoption

##### Adopter 1 - [Open Horizon](https://github.com/open-horizon) / Edge

_Joe Pearson (IBM), TAC chair at LF Edge_
JANUARY 2025

Open Horizon is a LF Edge Foundation project that provides a platform for managing the service software lifecycle of containerized workloads and related machine learning assets. Open Horizon has been working with the KubeArmor project for approximately 18 months to ensure platform adopters can gain confidence that workloads deployed on the platform are secure and operating within the defined policy. As Open Horizon is designed for bare metal hosts and clusters, they reached out to KubeArmor to provide security coverage across multiple environments. Open Horizon’s integration with KubeArmor is compatible with any container runtime running on bare metal.

The Open Horizon team was originally unfamiliar with the runtime security space but leveraged their network of colleagues and community members to initiate discovery of open source projects in the space that provide protection and multiple layers (such as the file system and operating system) through a simple, easy to use security policy. KubeArmor’s capabilities align well with the premise of how Open Horizon operates (through defined policies) and is compatible with their deployment policies.

Open Horizon’s KubeArmor integration is not officially finalized, as the two projects plan to provide two different deployment models. The first is delivery of the KubeArmor client as a containerized workload delivered by Horizon (near complete) and the second is by embedding KubeArmor into Open Horizon (development happening later this year). The intent is to make KubeArmor available to developers through these deployment models so regardless of which model is chosen, organizations adopting Open Horizon have the benefit of security policy enforcement out of the box when properly configured.

Open Horizon’s development and integration with KubeArmor is against the “latest” tag of the project and has plans to pin the version of KubeAmor for their embedded implementation.

Open Horizon’s collaboration with KubeArmor allows the teams to work independently on their respective code bases with a regularly occurring, dedicated subgroup meeting to ensure they’re aligned and working towards the same objectives, features, and functionality. Where KubeArmor requires changes to Open Horizon, primarily through updates to Open Horizon documentation, the KubeArmor team has submitted the changes following Open Horizon’s existing process, demonstrating collaborative participation in open source. Open Horizon shared that KubeArmor’s docs are very impressive and thorough, providing the Open Horizon team with some tips and tricks that are used to support generation of Open Horizon’s documentation. They also shared that KubeArmor’s current maturity and operation is similar to a Stage 2 project in LF Edge (akin to CNCF Incubating) albeit slightly early.

Engagements by Open Horizon with KubeArmor have been pleasant. Open Horizon shared the KubeArmor team is great to work with, primarily engaged in email and slack but they also make use of Open Horizon’s chat server (matrix) with leadership, senior developer/architect and developer level engagement in the subgroup meeting.

Open Horizon’s integration of KubeArmor has provided closure of several security gaps Open Horizon’s adopters were looking for, such as explicit access control enforcement through policies, but has not had sufficient time to ascertain measurable value. If the project were archived today, Open Horizon would need to find a replacement project to provide equivalent functionality for their adopters. 

Open Horizon shared that a common challenge with many open source projects developed by startups is achieving maintainer diversity and therefore is a key area of focus for the project to ensure survivability as well as meet expectations of a CNCF graduated project.

Open Horizon shared that KubeArmor generally is a well rounded project, encompassing features and capabilities typically not found in early maturity software. KubeArmor has explicit host and access protection as well as containerized workload protection. The project is currently exploring protection for workload connectivity, outside the host or cluster itself. In cases working with other cloud native projects to achieve this. Open Horizon currently has no additional plans with KubeArmor beyond embedding it within Open Horizon as shared earlier.


##### Adopter 2 - R6 Security / Cloud Security

_Zsolt Nemeth, R6 Security_
JANUARY 2025

R6 Security began adoption of KubeArmor in October 2023 before KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Chicago. R6’s architecture utilizes a series of tools that function as triggers with corresponding platform integrations to form security events that spawn automated defense mechanisms (reference Phoenix AMTD) for applications deployed to Kubernetes.

![R6 Phoenix Architecture](https://github.com/r6security/phoenix/blob/main/docs/img/architecture.jpg 'R6 Phoenix Architecture') Source: https://github.com/r6security/phoenix/blob/main/docs/img/architecture.jpg

Initially leveraging Prometheus, and adopting Falco for additional alerting, R6 Security expanded its triggers in November 2023 to take advantage of rulesets and policies for detecting unauthorized activity; this was prior to Falco’s recent response engine, Talon. 

R6 Security’s decision to include KubeArmor, Falco, and RAD Security (formerly KSOC labs) was largely driven by customer requests and adds event-based triggers to R6 Security’s own time-based trigger. Contributing to R6’s decision to expand beyond one project, in 2023 Falco was experiencing upstream support issues that made pure reliance unfeasible for the Company; these issues have since been resolved.  Combined, these technologies provided their customers with comprehensive detection through layered complementary and overlapping capabilities, ensuring very little, if any, adversarial or unauthorized activity is unnoticed. 

KubeArmor covers a small portion of their overall architecture, making up less than 8% of the overall detection. R6 Security has approximately 200-250 users on their freemium edition which includes KubeArmor and Falco, primarily located in south-eastern Europe. More than half of these users leverage KubeArmor in production. R6 Security also shared that approximately 2-3 customers have upgraded to the enterprise equivalent of KubeArmor, while many are still using the project version.

R6 Security defers to its customers for pulling updated versions of projects into their solution. It took R6 Security less than a day to integrate KubeArmor into their architecture, at a time when the project documentation was less robust and helm charts were not available. Since then, significant improvements have been made to the project’s documentation, particularly it’s API docs. R6 Security shared that the project is very responsive to requests, citing an issue a few months ago where one of the triggers was not functioning for their users. After working with the KubeArmor team to diagnose the source of the problem, it was confirmed the issue was on R6 Security’s implementation.

R6 Security shared much of the value their integration with KubeArmor has provided was in providing more robust coverage for their customers as requested. R6 Security provides its paying customers with additional security datasets from these triggers through their grafana dashboard.

If the KubeArmor project were archived now or in the future, R6 Security would likely fork the project to ensure it remained compatible with Kubernetes releases, but the overall impact would be minimal as R6 Security’s custom rules with Prometheus and the existing ruleset with Falco cover a lot.

R6 Security shared that KubeArmor overall is a robust project, but many differentiating features are available with the Enterprise edition from vendor Accuknox, who employs nearly all the maintainers. If and when these features and capabilities are contributed to KubeArmor, the project could experience more adoption, distinguishing itself from other runtime security projects in the ecosystem.  As a security project, the layered PR review process can sometimes slow down the incorporation of new features, but overall was the only remaining challenge R6 Security saw with the project once the documentation had been improved.

The biggest strengths of KubeArmor, as shared by R6 Security, are the complex policies that it allows to be set and configured. Providing the findings as a json file is great for users who wish to manipulate or combine this dataset with other sources like Prometheus.

##### Adopter 4 - Cloud Services

_Alok Raj_
MARCH 2025

Adopter 4 begin exploring cloud native solutions that focused on runtime security to harden and improve both their development and production environments just over two years ago. Like many organizations early to runtime security, initial features of Falco provided an early set of capabilities based on rules, and the company moved forward with an initial Falco proof of concept after confirming other more traditional security products like Tenable did not address cloud native runtime security adequately. During the course of their proof of concept development for Falco, Adopter 4 identified a significant level of effort to write their own rules, evaluate existing ones, and apply any additional customizations which pushed them to consider looking at other projects with similar capabilities. KubeArmor provided similar but more expanded capabilities as compared to the version of Falco under evaluation at the time, and Adopter 4 began development with a proof of concept. The key benefit that Adopter 4 cited as beneficial for their use case was the network security policy and enforcement of security policies through LSMs.  As their proof of concept reached maturity and success, Adopter 4 identified additional security requirements and chose to pursue enterprise support for KubeArmor.


For their initial proof of concept, Adopter 4 deployed their own product to a sandbox cluster alongside their ELK stack with additional in house tooling for optimizing application efficiency to understand how KubeArmor could detect product behaviors based on process executions. Adopter 4 included alert manager to send alerts to their slack channels for awareness and quick mitigation, which expanded across teams and clusters due to ease of use.


Adopter 4 then deployed KubeArmor and their own policies in audit mode, leaving the application running for 3 weeks and against all end points to different teams to generate traffic. After 3 weeks, all metrics are sent to Prometheus and logs to ELK. They also set up a public EKS and deployed a sample of applications (sandbox account without internal network access), for internal teams to use those applications, and see processes being executed into. To check the efficiency of the KubeArmor to detect one of their end points in the public instance, they provided access via jupyter notebooks, to identify malicious process detection by KubeArmor. Some of the policies they had running were in deny mode and others in audit to compare against. After 3 weeks, the team deployed to the cloud for a month, removed the cluster, and analyzed all the alerts generated and blocked, moving policies to deny mode and evaluating alerting on application behavior. They also engaged one of their vendors to perform penetration testing and security assessment against the environment to understand what else KubeArmor could detect and block.


The initial proof of concept highlighted scaling issues due to the high level of effort in setting up the logic and managing alert manager for expanded clusters and teams, citing continuous need to upgrade alert manager, kibana, and other tooling. One specific challenge was managing the large number of KubeArmor policies (harkening back to the large ruleset from Falco), since they had so many different applications to provide coverage of, the total number of policies that got deployed was close to 1800, they found handling this difficult. This also contributed to the company’s decision to seek enterprise support.


Adopter 4 currently uses KubeArmor 1.5.1 in production with their development releases on 1.5.2. The Company’s eventual cadence target is n-1 version for dev, and n-2 for prod environments. Once fully tested and running well, then they upgrade production. Adopter 4 does not use the latest release opting to create a proof of concept within a sandboxed environment to understand those changes in order to promote the most recent release of KubeArmor to dev. KubeArmor is deployed in development for approximately 20-25 clusters and in production for 8-10 clusters with almost all clusters in production containing 10-12 nodes.


One of the additional benefits Adopter 4 is using KubeArmor for is understanding the overall security of their cloud product and using KubeArmor as a test for how their product performs. By evaluating how their product’s performance and operations trigger alerts with KubeArmor, they’ve been able to improve the overall security posture, reporting, and alerting of their product. Running their product in development with KubeArmor installed allowed their security team to identify riskier application behaviors for resolution with the engineering team.  Using KubeArmor not only for their own operational security but also as a tool to evaluate product security performance, ultimately assists Adopter 4 in providing a more mature and robust secured product by reducing the number of false positives their customers may encounter during use.
Adopter 4 found the documentation on the project’s repository sufficient to get started with their proof of concept and did engage the project maintainers on a few occasions, particularly for support with writing policies, and found the engagement with the project maintainers to be very positive and collaborative.  


Adopter 4 has found significant value in their initial adoption of KubeArmor and eventual decisions to pursue enterprise support of the open source project because it reduces previous manual activities, eventually helped the security posture in their product environment, and reduce security alerting of the product by customers. Adopter 4 even cited certain events where malicious activity happened in their cluster and guard duty couldn't detect it since it looks at a different mechanism. Since implementing KubeArmor 1.5 years ago, Adopter 4 has had no issues reported.


When asked about their dependency on KubeArmor from a project health perspective, Adopter 4 would be less impacted if the project were archived or to slow in its development due to Adopter 4’s existing support contract with AccuKnox. It was noted that while a diversity of maintainers does exist in the project, if the primary employer (AccuKnox) were to withdraw from the project, the level of effort to maintain the project is substantial and require Adopter 4 to maintain a fork until a suitable replacement can be found. 


For future efforts with KubeArmor specifically, Adopter 4 did share that they’ve been discussing the possibility of developing a policy bundle to create and manage out of the box policies for easier stand up and deployment in addition to formalizing industry best practices in these policies (such as no process execution from /tmp and file integrity check for /etc), all deployable with one click.
