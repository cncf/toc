# Container Networking Interface (CNI)

**Project Name:** cni

**Description**

The CNI (Container Network Interface) project consists of a specification and libraries for writing plugins to configure network interfaces
in Linux containers, along with a number of supported plugins. CNI concerns itself only with network connectivity of containers and removing
allocated resources when the container is deleted. Because of this focus, CNI has a wide range of support and the specification is simple to
implement. CNI consists of 3 separate components:

*  CNI Specification: defines an straightforward API between runtimes and network plugins for container network setup/teardown.  No more, no less.
*  Plugins: provide network setup for a variety of use-cases and serve as reference examples of plugins conforming to the CNI specification
*  Library: provide a Go implementation of the CNI specification that runtimes can use to more easily consume CNI

NOTE: CNI Specification is independently versioned from the CNI library and plugins in the repository (e.g. the versions of releases). The plugins are being pulled out into a separate repository

**Adopters:**

* rkt - container engine
* Kurma - container runtime
* Kubernetes - a system to simplify container operations
* Cloud Foundry - a platform for cloud applications
* Mesos - a distributed systems kernel

There is also a large ecosystem of third party plug-ins:

* Project Calico - a layer 3 virtual network
* Weave - a multi-host Docker network
* Contiv Networking - policy networking for various use cases
* SR-IOV
* Cilium - BPF & XDP for containers
* Infoblox - enterprise IP address management for containers
* Multus - a Multi plugin
* Romana - Layer 3 CNI plugin supporting network policy for Kubernetes
* CNI-Genie - generic CNI network plugin

**Statement on alignment with CNCF mission**:

CNI defines initial guidelines for a network interface specification focused on
connectivity and portability of cloud native application patterns.
It is already supported by many cloud native and container runtimes discussed
in the adopters section of this document.
