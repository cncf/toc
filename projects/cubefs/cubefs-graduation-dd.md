  <!-- This template provides the TOC with the outline for completing due diligence of a project to move levels. This universal template is designed to capture all criteria so the TOC may ensure prior level criteria do not regress. As part of completing the due diligence, the TOC member should update the template to convey the level the project applied for the criteria by bolding the level indicated where the criteria is relevant. -->

## Graduation Evaluation Summary for CubeFS

### Criteria Evaluation

Kevin Wang conducted the due diligence of CubeFS who applied for graduation. The project has completed the criteria that show its maturity at graduation.

The following criteria implementations are noteworthy to call out:

- A stable and easily maintainable distributed file system, with excellent concurrent write performance, scalability and extensibility.
- Has a strong and growing community of maintainers and adopters, ensuring its long-term sustainability.
- Provided diverse channels for community users and contributors to interact, and public meeting links, recordings and notes can be easily found.
- Provided high-quality, well-organized documentation and practical examples to help users quickly learn and master the project.
- The project completed the  [third party security audit by Ada Logics](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/blob/206d5ddadf1f99abde6401b7aa18b57fc46e6bed/security/CubeFS-security-audit-2023-report.pdf) with no high-level or critical issues found. The project team actively resolved the 12 detected issues, clearly demonstrated commitment to security, which is praiseworthy.

The following actions were provided to the project that were considered blocking but have since been resolved:

- Removed the Project Lead role, previously held by one individual and considered conflicting with community neutrality. And instead, established a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) with a defined number of seats and neutrality requirements.
- Updated the governance documents to clarify the management rules for subprojects.
- Added a [RELEASE.md](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/blob/206d5ddadf1f99abde6401b7aa18b57fc46e6bed/RELEASE.md) file, including updating the release process to reflect the latest engineering principles criteria.
- Updated the governance documents to include roadmap changing process.

The following recommendations were provided to the project that are non-blocking in the TOC's assessment but should be completed by the project to ensure continued viability of the project:

- TOC Reviewer recommends finalizing the ongoing Governance Review by the TAG Contributor Strategy to achieve a more comprehensive community governance.
- TOC Reviewer recommends to extend its current management rules to cover all repos under the GitHub organization, including non-subproject repos, and archive any repos that are no longer being maintained.
- Make full use of `cubefs-community` repo, as the canonical location for community governance-related documents.
- TOC Reviewer recommends improving the project's extensibility and adding more pluggable framework designs. This would facilitate easier customization and easier decoupling of downstream enhancements by adopters.
- TOC Reviewer recommends improving feature lifecycle management, including feature maturity, configuration, commit history, and release notes. This would make it easier for adopters to track community updates and backport patches as needed.
- TOC Reviewer recommends to establish Adopters WG or other similar group, as a dedicated space for adopters to collaborate on shared features and functionality to continue improving and enhancing the project.
- To foster a more inclusive global community, TOC Reviewer recommends making a plan for global community development. This plan may include initiatives like English-language community meetings and cultivating contributors from various regions to better support adopters worldwide.
- TOC Reviewer recommends organizing dedicated TSC meeting, in order to keep TSC members engaged.
- To enhance community decision-making transparency, the TOC Reviewer recommends the project provide explicit records of voting processes, e.g. manual vote counts or using [gitvote](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote).
- TOC Reviewer recommends to add explicit description of platforms supported in the [RELEASE.md](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/blob/206d5ddadf1f99abde6401b7aa18b57fc46e6bed/RELEASE.md)
- TOC Reviewer recommends to cross reference the [roadmap governance(https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/blob/206d5ddadf1f99abde6401b7aa18b57fc46e6bed/GOVERNANCE.md#roadmap)] and [change process](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/blob/206d5ddadf1f99abde6401b7aa18b57fc46e6bed/GOVERNANCE.md#changes-in-project-roadmap) on the [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/blob/206d5ddadf1f99abde6401b7aa18b57fc46e6bed/ROADMAP.md) to make it easier to find for potential contributors.
- And for the [roadmap change process](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/blob/206d5ddadf1f99abde6401b7aa18b57fc46e6bed/GOVERNANCE.md#changes-in-project-roadmap), it's recommended to include collecting roadmap proposals through public channels, and use more community fashion phrasing, which would encourage contributors to join the discussion and better understand where the project is heading to.
- TOC Reviewer recommends to update security policy to include an embargo and private disclosure period before doing public disclosure for security vulnerabilities. And tagging a release clearly as "security-fixes-only" will help users to prioritize an upgrade.

### Adoption Evaluation

The adopter interviews reflect the production grade usage of CubeFS for the applied Graduation level. According to the feedback, CubeFS simplifies the interaction between users and storage infrastructure by providing a high-performance, scalable, reliable and easy-to-maintain distributed file system. Developers leverage CubeFS to address the challenges of complex distributed file systems, including large-scale data storage, high concurrent access, data reliability and the complexity of system maintenance. Adopters have been using CubeFS in the production environment for many years, managing data ranging from hundreds of terabytes to petabytes and supporting the access of millions of clients. Overall, the stability, reliable performance and active community of CubeFS have built the trust of adopters.

### Final Assessment

The TOC has found the project to have satisfied the criteria for Graduation.

## Governance and Maintainers

Note: this section may be augmented by the completion of a Governance Review from TAG Contributor Strategy.

### Suggested

- [x] **Governance has continuously been iterated upon by the project as a result of their experience applying it, with the governance history demonstrating evolution of maturity alongside the project's maturity evolution.**

  CubeFS has been continuously updating governance doc to reflect project growth, some examples are:
  - CubeFS initial governance: <https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/blob/v1.1.0/GOVERNANCE.md>
  - Added Committer role in May. 2023: <https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/1976>
  - Added Steering Committee in Apr. 2024: <https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/3312>
  - Update maintainer list according to activity and add steering committee member: <https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/3311>
  - Update the Governance Document to eliminate the role of the leader: <https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/3382>
    The description of 'project lead' implies a somewhat authoritarian role, but with the establishment of a Steering Committee, the Steering Committee should be considered the highest decision-making body.Thus CubeFS delete the role of 'project lead'.

#### Adoption

##### Adopter 1 - NetEase / Internet

NetEase has integrated CubeFS into its cloud-native infrastructure since 2020, using it as a distributed file system solution. After a thorough evaluation of various options, CubeFS was selected for its superior scalability and reliability. Currently in production, NetEase's deployment spans over 200 servers and manages more than 15 petabytes of user data.

The core features of CubeFS that NetEase finds most valuable are high availability, fault tolerance, and the ability to handle large data volumes efficiently. These functionalities have made CubeFS an integral part of their cloud operations. The project's compatibility with Kubernetes has also been a significant advantage.

During the implementation phase, NetEase found the documentation quite helpful, although there was an initial challenge in understanding the architecture. They received community support that helped them overcome these initial hurdles.

NetEase upgrades their deployment of CubeFS with one minor release per year and patch releases as needed. CubeFS releases are usually stable and upgrades can be done with automated scripts in most cases.

Looking ahead, NetEase intends to increase its engagement with the CubeFS community and explore additional features that could enhance their cloud services. They view the project as a valuable asset that has not only met their storage needs but also contributed to their learning and development in distributed systems.

The adoption of CubeFS has been a significant benefit for NetEase, enhancing its cloud services with a robust and scalable storage solution. The project's stability and clear scope and roadmap have built trust with NetEase, making it a reliable component for its cloud-native infrastructure needs.

##### Adopter 2 - BEIKE / Housing Transactions and Services

BEIKE has been using CubeFS since early 2020, starting with version 2.3. Currently, they are using version 3.3.1 in a large-scale production environment with a total capacity of 30PB (triple-replica redundancy), and some legacy environments are still running on version 2.4.

The main motivation for adoption was CubeFS's overall read/write and concurrency performance, scalability, as well as the ability to seamlessly integrate with existing infrastructure.

The adoption resulted in saving storage costs and easier debugging and problem resolution. The disk throttling feature has been useful, and the fault tolerance and data consistency features have been crucial in maintaining service continuity, even during peak business periods.

During the migration from NFS to CubeFS, they faced challenges with decreased write performance for small files. They also met issues with the HDFS data integration tool due to lack of maintenance. And BEIKE found the CubeFS documentation to be comprehensive and the community support to be responsive, which has been instrumental in the successful integration and ongoing maintenance of the system.

The community is open and friendly, BEIKE mainly participates in discussions in the WeChat group and attends monthly meetings, and contributes back when possible. Looking ahead, BEIKE hopes to be more involved in feature planning, enhancement discussions, and foster deeper collaboration with other community members.

Overall, CubeFS's strengths include concurrent read and write operations and efficient bandwidth utilization. Areas for improvement include cleaner git commit history management, making features pluggable, and improving compatibility for upgrading historical versions. The community also needs to improve its promotion and outreach efforts.

##### Adopter3 - Live Streaming and Short Video

Adopter3 started to use CubeFS in the second half of 2022. It began with testing and was deployed for production in January 2023. The key reason for adopting CubeFS was its ability to handle concurrent writes and the capability to horizontally scale metadata nodes. These were major advantages compared to HDFS and CephFS, which had constraints in performance, maintenance, and handling small files.

CubeFS has been convenient to use with its FUSE mounting. It has been integrated with the Kubernetes clusters and is also used directly on physical machines in some scenarios. The community documentation has been helpful to the adopter for learning about APIs, RESTful commands, and the architecture. Some internal business units have transitioned from CephFS to CubeFS, benefiting from reduced maintenance time. The replacement of HDFS with CubeFS is in progress.

In the future, Adopter3 plans to use the EC (Erasure Coding) feature when the community's architecture becomes more stable. Currently, they are focusing on replacing HDFS. Adopter3 has 3 committers in the community, interacting with maintainers primarily through WeChat group discussions.

Overall, the CubeFS project is considered stable. However, there is room for improvement in areas such as covering more corner cases, promoting the project more effectively, and enhancing the format and content of issue and PR descriptions to facilitate better maintenance.
