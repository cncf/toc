<!-- This template provides the TOC with the outline for completing due diligence of a project to move levels. This universal template is designed to capture all criteria so the TOC may ensure prior level criteria do not regress. As part of completing the due diligence, the TOC member should update the template to convey the level the project applied for the criteria by bolding the level indicated where the criteria is relevant. -->

## Graduation Evaluation Summary for Dragonfly

### Criteria Evaluation

Kevin Wang completed the due diligence for Dragonfly's graduation, building on the initial work of Karena Angell and Nikhita Raghunath. This effort was also supported by a [Governance Review from Bob Killen](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/1885) and a [joint security assessment from TAG Security](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/pull/1443). The project has met the graduation criteria, demonstrating its maturity.

- The following criteria implementations are noteworthy to call out.
  - Dragonfly is a mature project endorsed by multiple production adopters across diverse industries, demonstrating significant business value with reported cost reductions up to 90% and bandwidth savings up to 70% in large-scale deployments.
  - The project demonstrates strong vendor neutrality with 13 maintainers from 7 different organizations. The governance explicitly documents a maximum representation policy ensuring no more than 4 maintainers from the same company, promoting balanced community leadership.
  - Dragonfly has comprehensive and well-organized documentation covering architecture, deployment guides, integration tutorials for multiple CNCF projects (containerd, cri-o, Harbor, Kubernetes), and clear release processes. The documentation includes both user-facing and contributor guides.
  - The project successfully completed a third-party security audit by Trail of Bits with all findings resolved, and achieved 100% on the OpenSSF Best Practices badge, demonstrating commitment to security best practices.
  - Dragonfly has strong ecosystem integration with 10+ CNCF projects and is actively expanding to support emerging AI/ML workloads, showing adaptability to evolving cloud-native use cases.
  - The project has resolved all findings and suggestions from the CNCF Governance Review (Issue #1599), including unified governance documentation and elimination of outdated links and redundancies.

- The following actions were provided to the project that were considered blocking but since resolved.
  - Missing process and list for subprojects, while Nydus was known as a subproject. This was fixed with the document at <https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/REPOSITORIES.md#core-repositories> and <https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/REPOSITORY-GUIDELINES.md>.
  - Improved RELEASE.md to define a more detailed release process and guidelines, Ref: <https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/pull/22>.

- The following recommendations were provided to the project that are non-blocking in the TOC's assessment but should be completed by the project to ensure continued viability of the project.
  - The TOC Reviewer suggests completing a General Technical Review post-graduation and maintaining GTR documentation. Ref: <https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/tech-review.yml>
  - The temporary link used for joining Dingtalk had expired. The TOC Reviewer suggested updating the instructions with the group search number. This finding was resolved before the final due diligence report completion. Ref: <https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/issues/4298>.
  - TOC Reviewer suggested adding documentation explaining how the project handles requests to the CNCF, and changes to governance or project goals. This finding was resolved before the final due diligence report completion. Ref: <https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/issues/4324>.
  - There are duplicated definitions of "Adding New Member/Approver/Maintainer" in the community documents (in COMMUNITY_LADDER.md and COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md). TOC Reviewer suggests to consolidate these into a single source of truth. Ref: <https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/issues/4325>.
  - The TOC Reviewer suggests to document the responsibilities and focus areas for each maintainer (including community wide maintainers and subproject maintainer) in MAINTAINERS.md. Even if there is no differentiation among maintainers, it should be explicitly stated to provide clarity on maintainer roles within the project.
  - The TOC Reviewer suggests to add the violation reporting email address to CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to clarify how community members can report instances of unacceptable behavior. For example: "Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at {email address here}."
  - The TOC reviewer suggests to set a unified place to document all the community channels including community wide channels and subproject, area focused channels.
  - The TOC Reviewer suggests the project maintainers to maintain a GTR file and complete Domain Technical Review after the graduation DD.
  - The TOC reviewer suggests the security policy cross-linked by all the subproject repos.
  - The TOC reviewer suggests add a copy of [Security Self-Assessment](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/assessments/projects/dragonfly/self-assessment.md) to [dragonflyoss/community](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community).
  - The TOC reviewer suggests include the adoption level for each adopter (e.g., dev/trialing, prod, etc.) in ADOPTERS.md to provide clearer insight into how the project is being used across different organizations.
  - The TOC Reviewer suggests the project to plan and participate the [CNCF Mentoring Programs](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/programs) for future contributor recruitment.

### Adoption Evaluation

  The adopter interviews reflect production-grade usage of Dragonfly at the Graduation level. Four adopters from multiple industries were interviewed, demonstrating 1.5 to 6 years of production experience. All adopters deployed Dragonfly to solve critical challenges in large-scale distributed file and image distribution, particularly addressing bandwidth constraints, reducing infrastructure costs, and accelerating content delivery in cloud-native and AI/ML environments.

  Adopters reported significant measurable benefits: bandwidth consumption reduced by 70-90%, cost savings up to 90% in image pull operations, and startup time improvements of 50% or more. Dragonfly currently supports deployments ranging from medium-scale cloud migration projects to petabyte-scale daily downloads serving millions of client machines. Use cases span container image acceleration, object storage distribution, configuration file delivery, and emerging AI model distribution workloads.

  All interviewed adopters praised Dragonfly's stability at scale, P2P distribution efficiency, cloud-native deployment model, and seamless integration with container registries and runtimes. They actively engage with the community through GitHub, DingTalk, and Slack, experiencing responsive maintainer support with critical issues resolved within 2-3 business days. The adopters view Dragonfly's clean architecture, strong CNCF governance, and adaptability to evolving cloud-native and AI infrastructure requirements as key strengths that establish long-term trust and confidence in the project.

  - [x] Tagging as stable, unstable, and security related releases
  - [x] Information on branch and tag strategies
  - [x] Branch and platform support and length of support
  - [x] Artifacts included in the release.
  - Additional information on topics such as LTS and edge releases are optional. Release expectations are a social contract between the project and its end users and hence changes to these should be well thought out, discussed, socialized and as necessary agreed upon by project leadership before getting rolled out.

  <!-- (TOC Evaluation goes here) -->
  Dragonfly documents its release process and guidelines at <https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/RELEASE-PROCEDURE.md> and <https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/RELEASE.md>.

  The document clearly addresses all required elements:

  - **Release expectations**: Follows a structured 26-week (6-month) release cycle with defined phases - 4 weeks for feature definition, 18 weeks for implementation, and 4 weeks for stabilization.

  - **Tagging strategy**: Uses semantic versioning with clear conventions - stable releases (e.g., v2.1.0), and pre-release versions with suffixes (e.g., v2.1.0-alpha.x, v2.1.0-beta.x, v2.1.0-rc.x).

  - **Branch and tag strategies**: Alpha/Beta tags are created from the main branch, while Release-Candidate and Release tags are created from stable branches following the `release-<major>.<minor>` naming convention.

  - **Support lifecycle**: Provides a 6-month maintenance phase for each release, with support provided only for the immediately preceding version. Bug fixes are merged to main branch first, then cherry-picked to release branches.

  - **Artifacts**: While not explicitly detailed in a dedicated section, the document references release procedures and notes that are published on GitHub releases, with container images distributed via appropriate registries.

  The document also defines team responsibilities, including the release manager role, and outlines communication channels for release announcements.

- [x] **History of regular, quality releases.**

#### Adoption

##### Adopter 1 - Technology and Content Platform

  The adopter started using Dragonfly in production around 2021-2022 when their organization's cloud platform launched it as an official product offering. The interviewee's team began using Dragonfly in 2023 as part of a multi-year cloud migration project. The primary motivation for adopting Dragonfly was to address critical bandwidth constraints on the dedicated network link between on-premise data centers and cloud environments. During the cloud migration, the container registry remained in the internal data center with limited bandwidth (less than 20 Gbps), which frequently became saturated when cloud-based applications pulled container images. Dragonfly was selected over an internal HTTP P2P system for two key reasons: enterprise support and maintenance guarantees from the organization's cloud platform official offering, and a cloud-native deployment model using Helm Charts that significantly reduced operational overhead compared to manual deployment scripts.

  Dragonfly has delivered substantial and measurable business value for the adopter. Most critically, it ensured operational stability during the cloud migration project by effectively addressing the bandwidth constraint problem. Without Dragonfly, the migration would have faced significant delays and reliability issues. The deployment achieved remarkable cost savings, reducing bandwidth consumption on the dedicated link from 100% saturation (causing application performance degradation) to approximately 10% utilization. This reduction covered both container image and configuration file traffic. The adopter uses two key features: container registry integration with containerd for transparent image acceleration, and HTTP proxy-based file distribution for configuration files stored in object storage. The adoption experience was smooth, with minimal integration effort required. The team developed a custom SDK using environment variables to enable applications to download files through Dragonfly while maintaining minimal impact on application code.

  Looking forward, the adopter plans to maintain active collaboration in the community, including participation in Rust version development. They have identified two key areas for improvement: enhanced observability with additional metrics for large-scale deployments (the team has already added custom metrics internally), and improved multi-cluster support to reduce operational overhead across the adopter's many small-to-medium clusters. The adopter values the community's openness, responsive maintainers, and strong governance under CNCF. They engage actively through GitHub issues, DingTalk, and Slack, with maintainers providing fixes within 2-3 business days for critical issues. The team suggests that Dragonfly could expand beyond container image distribution with richer use case documentation, including detailed case studies showing migration paths from pilot to production, AI/ML workflow integration patterns, and performance tuning guides.

  The adopter views Dragonfly's clean architecture, cloud-native deployment model, seamless container registry integration, and strong Nydus ecosystem integration as key strengths. They believe graduating within CNCF would increase visibility and credibility, encouraging broader adoption across the industry.

##### Adopter 2 - AI/Large Language Model Infrastructure

  This adopter started using Dragonfly approximately one and a half years ago, beginning with v1.x and recently upgrading to v2.3. The primary motivation for adopting Dragonfly was to address critical challenges in large-scale image distribution for AI model training infrastructure. During their research phase, they found limited alternatives that could effectively accelerate image distribution at scale. Dragonfly stood out due to its proven track record among large companies, CNCF project reliability, cloud-native deployment capabilities, and being written in Go for potential customization. The interviewee's prior successful experience with Dragonfly at their previous company further validated the adoption decision.

  Dragonfly has delivered substantial business value across multiple dimensions for this AI-focused organization. The system is deployed in production as a key infrastructure component across all computing clusters, supporting large-scale model training operations. The P2P distribution capability has generated significant bandwidth savings and cost reductions. Most importantly, Dragonfly has dramatically improved training task startup success rates by alleviating pressure on upstream registries and reducing image pull failures and timeouts - critical factors for large-scale AI training workloads. Pod startup speeds have been significantly accelerated, and the solution has reduced operational burden for the infrastructure team. The organization considers Dragonfly essential to their operations, with deployment described as very large scale, though specific metrics remain confidential.

  The adopter maintains active engagement with the Dragonfly community and plans to continue this collaboration. They consistently provide feedback on issues encountered, such as network file system compatibility problems that were quickly resolved by community developers. Looking forward, they are particularly interested in AI/ML-specific acceleration features, especially capabilities for large language model distribution and accelerating model weight distribution. The organization suggests the project could further strengthen its position in the AI infrastructure space by developing technical solutions tailored to large model distribution scenarios. They emphasize the value of timely Chinese documentation synchronization and improved support for legacy container runtime interfaces.

  The adopter highly values the community's openness, mature governance, maintainer diversity, and responsive communication channels. They praise the fast response times and enthusiastic developer engagement through multiple channels including DingTalk, GitHub, and biweekly meetings. The organization relies on CNCF maturity levels as a strong reference point for adoption decisions, prioritizing Graduated projects for production deployments. They view Dragonfly's community and technical capabilities as well-aligned with the growing demands of AI infrastructure, particularly for efficient distribution in large-scale model training environments.

##### Adopter 3 - Live Streaming and Short Video

  The adopter has been using Dragonfly for approximately five years, since 2020. The large-scale production deployment also began in 2020, following extensive canary testing and validation. The primary motivations for adopting Dragonfly were its active community engagement, clear and well-structured architecture design, accessible documentation and codebase, and the strategic partnership with Alibaba Cloud as the primary maintainer. These factors positioned Dragonfly as the preferred P2P distribution solution over alternatives like Kraken, which had become unmaintained by late 2019.

  Dragonfly has delivered substantial and measurable benefits across the adopter's infrastructure, deployed in full production to support over 80% of their internal services. The organization has publicly disclosed significant performance improvements in three key areas: reduced Harbor registry bandwidth pressure by approximately 70% on average (up to 80% during peak periods) through P2P distribution; lowered overall image pull costs by approximately 90%, including network, storage, bandwidth, and transfer resources; and accelerated instance startup times by an average of 50%. The system currently supports three primary use cases: general object storage acceleration for big data and multimedia distribution, cloud-native container image acceleration and distribution, and AI model file distribution introduced in 2025. Key features utilized include proactive image preheating, multi-tier caching from memory to SSD for enhanced P2P efficiency, and Nydus on-demand loading which has enabled approximately 60% of their services to achieve more than 50% reduction in startup time.

  Regarding future community participation, the adopter has already achieved comprehensive deployment across its infrastructure and plans to focus on feature requests and potential community contributions. The team's approach is to first submit feature requests to understand the community's perspective and roadmap alignment, with readiness to invest engineering resources for significant implementations. A specific example includes their request for P2P distribution support for large model parameter files within Dragonfly, similar to vLLM's P2P store functionality, which would enable framework-agnostic integration and reduce development costs. The organization actively engages with the community through GitHub issues, DingTalk group discussions, and participation in community meetings. Team members have already contributed pull requests and documentation improvements, and they express preference for community collaboration over isolated internal maintenance. The adopter suggests two areas for project improvement: evolving capabilities to better address emerging AI workload requirements and adding multilingual documentation support to improve accessibility for non-English-speaking regions. They also recommend encouraging involvement from excellent international companies to broaden the community's perspective and conducting deeper academic research exploration to identify new enhancement opportunities.

##### Adopter 4 - Cloud Computing Platform

  This adopter started using Dragonfly in production around early 2019, implementing Dragonfly v1.0 initially and has been using the project for approximately 6 years. The organization has since evolved to Dragonfly v2.x and currently runs v2.2.0 in production. The primary motivation for adopting Dragonfly was to resolve critical stability issues with their previous Java-based P2P solution, specifically eliminating back-to-source contention caused by randomized scheduling that created substantial load on origin servers during high concurrency periods.

  Dragonfly has delivered significant business value across multiple dimensions. The system now supports millions of client machines with daily download volumes reaching petabyte scale, while consistently maintaining back-to-source traffic below 1% of total download volume. This translates to massive cost savings in OSS bandwidth consumption and associated cloud storage costs. Additionally, Dragonfly eliminated complex manual network configuration requirements, dramatically reducing operational staff time and labor costs. The solution has successfully supported critical peak traffic events, including multiple "Double 11" sales periods, demonstrating its enterprise-grade stability.

  The adopter plans to maintain active collaboration in the community, focusing on issue triage and performance optimization discussions to ensure long-term stability. They have no new major feature requests as the core P2P distribution functionality fully meets their infrastructure needs. For future development, they suggest the project could benefit from expanding influence through comprehensive best practice case studies and exploring deeper integration with AI workflows, particularly for efficient distribution of large model binaries and datasets.

  The adopter views Dragonfly as having significant growth potential, especially with the rise of multi-cloud, edge computing, and AI model distribution challenges. They praise the community's openness, strong governance, and timely maintainer responsiveness, while noting that enhanced security and access control mechanisms would help unlock the project's full potential across diverse enterprise environments.
