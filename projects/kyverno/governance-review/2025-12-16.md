# Kyverno Governance Review

Following is a governance review and assessment for the Kyverno project. The review was executed at the request of the project as part of a requested change in maturity level. It was executed by @joshgav and @GenPage in December 2025 following [these CNCF guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/toc_subprojects/project-reviews-subproject) and by reviewing the following issues, the contents of the [github.com/kyverno](https://github.com/kyverno) organization, the [Kyverno website](https://kyverno.io), and other associated collateral.

- Graduation application: <https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1967>
- Governance review request: <https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1597>

## Summary and Assessment

**Status:** Satisfactory

### Must-Fix Items

**The following issues have been identified that need to be resolved before 
[project milestone or other requirement]:**

- None.

### Points of Excellence

**The following aspects of governance are exemplary, and can be referenced as
examples for other projects to copy:**

- A [Contributor Ladder](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#contributor-ladder) clearly describes roles and how to grow within the Kyverno maintainer community.
- The [kyverno/community](https://github.com/kyverno/community) repo collects all governance and maintainer info in one place.
- A strategic advisory committee with only advisory powers is [proposed](https://github.com/kyverno/community/pull/72) to support maintainers.


### Areas for Improvement

**Over the next year, the project should work on the following issues to improve
its governance, these are considered non-blocking:**

- Develop and onboard maintainers from more companies, particularly for sub-projects.
- Document the activities of the proposed steering committee through Google docs and GitHub issues.

---

## Review

**The following review primarily consists of an audit on the project's
self-assessment in their [Graduation application](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1967).**

### Governance Summary

The Kyverno project produces a controller that applies policies to Kubernetes resources as specified by custom declarative policy resources. In addition to this controller, the project also maintains an extensive set of example policies, a controller for generating reports about policy application, UIs for viewing reports, a CLI for one-off policy application and a system for applying policy to any JSON resource.

The project and its several sub-projects are governed by their maintainers and a proposed advisory steering committee as documented at [github.com/kyverno/community](https://github.com/kyverno/community).

### Governance Evolution

**Governance has continuously been iterated upon by the project as a result of
their experience applying it, with the governance history demonstrating
evolution of maturity alongside the project's maturity evolution.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Suggested

The Kyverno community created [github.com/kyverno/community](https://github.com/kyverno/community) in early 2024 to collect governance-related info and has iterated and added to these over the past two years. 

Notably, a contributor ladder was [added](https://github.com/kyverno/community/pull/48) in May 2025 and a Steering and Oversight Committee is [currently being added](https://github.com/kyverno/community/pull/72).

The project also keeps track of sub-projects (list [here](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#maintainer-areas)) and establishes rules for their governance and maintenance.

### Discoverability

**Clear and discoverable project governance documentation.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Kyverno's primary [GOVERNANCE.md document](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) is published in the [kyverno/community](https://github.com/kyverno/community) repo, linked in the [kyverno/kyverno](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno) repo and referenced on the website's [community page](https://kyverno.io/community/#project-governance).

It describes all applicable governance processes: principles, contributor roles, a progression process for contributors to become maintainers, meetings, conflict resolution, and how changes are made.

### Accuracy and Clarity

**Governance is up to date with actual project activities, including any
meetings, elections, leadership, or approval processes.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Meetings are held and notes taken as described on the [community page](https://kyverno.io/community/#meetings) and other documents.

Elections of new contributors and maintainers are executed via GitVote as configured [here](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/.gitvote.yml).

The proposed [steering committee](https://github.com/kyverno/community/pull/72) has not yet been formed. When formed it should document its activities through Google docs and GitHub issues.

The documented approval process for significant changes is being followed for example in [this discussion](https://github.com/kyverno/community/issues/69) of where to hold public conversations.

**Governance clearly documents [vendor-neutrality] of project direction.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

The governance doc [explicitly states](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#vendor-neutrality) that Kyverno follows CNCF vendor neutrality guidelines.

The project is in the process of establishing a vendor neutral Steering and Oversight Committee that will be responsible for roadmap and governance (see https://github.com/kyverno/community/pull/72).


### Decisions and Role Assignments

**Document how the project makes decisions on leadership roles, contribution
acceptance, requests to the CNCF, and changes to governance or project goals.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

As described in the GOVERNANCE doc, decisions about the project and its leadership are made by _Maintainers_ who are elected to their positions by existing maintainers. Some contributions may also be accepted by _Reviewers_.

Changes to governance or project goals are currently also in the hands of Maintainers. The Steering Committee as currently proposed in https://github.com/kyverno/community/pull/72 will provide non-binding advice to Maintainers.

**Document how role, function-based members, or sub-teams are assigned,
onboarded, and removed for specific teams (example: Security Response
Committee).**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

The same process described in the GOVERNANCE doc is applied for the main Kyverno project and all sub-projects - Contributors progress to become Reviewers and then Maintainers.

Maintainers for Kyverno and its sub-projects are listed in a [MAINTAINERS file](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) in kyverno/community and in some sub-project repos.

A process for off-boarding maintainers and other contributors is documented in the GOVERNANCE doc and emeritus maintainers are acknowledged.

### Maintainers and Maintainer Lifecycle

**Document a complete maintainer lifecycle process (including roles, onboarding,
offboarding, and emeritus status).**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

The project's GOVERNANCE doc describes how contributors onboard - by making 5 contributions, become reviewers - upon further collaboration and approval by maintainers, and become maintainers - following ongoing significant contributions and approval by existing maintainers. Maintainer and contributor offboarding voluntarily or due to non-participation is also documented in the GOVERNANCE doc.

**Demonstrate usage of the maintainer lifecycle with outcomes, either through
the addition or replacement of maintainers as project events have required.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

The [history of the kyverno/community repo](https://github.com/kyverno/community/commits/main/) demonstrates onboarding and offboarding of contributors and maintainers as well as the addition of new project areas like the Backstage plugin.

**Document complete list of current maintainers, including names, contact
information, domain of responsibility, and affiliation.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

The [MAINTAINERS.md file](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) lists each maintainer, their GitHub ID and company affiliation. Sub‑project maintainers are similarly documented.

**A number of active maintainers which is appropriate to the size and scope of
the project.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

There are 8 current maintainers for kyverno/kyverno and at least 2 maintainers for each sub-project. There are 14 total maintainers across the kyverno projects.

**Project maintainers from at least 2 organizations that demonstrates
survivability.**
**Incubating:** N/A | **Graduated:** Required

Kyverno has active maintainers across four organizations (Nirmata, Chainguard, Kuaishou Technology, and VELUX). 5/8 maintainers of kyverno/kyverno are from Nirmata; 7/14 of maintainers of all projects and sub-projects are from Nirmata.

### Ownership

**Code and Doc ownership in Github and elsewhere matches documented governance
roles.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

Membership in private GitHub teams governs control of repositories corresponding to projects and sub‑projects, e.g., kyverno‑maintainers grants control of kyverno/kyverno, kyverno‑json‑maintainers of kyverno/kyverno-json, etc.

Each project has its maintainers listed separately in the main [MAINTAINERS.md file](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md). Documented roles correspond to actual code and documentation ownership through GitHub teams.

Each repository also has a CODEOWNERS file; [here is the CODEOWNERS file](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) for kyverno/kyverno.


### Code of Conduct

**Document adoption and adherence to the CNCF Code of Conduct or the project's
CoC which is based off the CNCF CoC and not in conflict with it.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

Kyverno's own [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) references the CNCF's code of conduct. Other repositories reference this primary code of conduct.


**CNCF Code of Conduct is cross-linked from other governance documents.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

Kyverno's own [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) references the CNCF's code of conduct [here](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#code-of-conduct).

### Subprojects

**All subprojects, if any, are listed.**
**Incubating:** Required | **Graduated:** Required

Subprojects are listed in the Kyverno [documentation](https://kyverno.io/docs/subprojects/) as well as on the main [GitHub organization page](https://github.com/kyverno).

The [MAINTAINERS.md file](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) also enumerates all sub-projects and their maintainers.


**If the project has subprojects: subproject leadership, contribution, maturity
status documented, including add/remove process.**
**Incubating:** Suggested | **Graduated:** Required

Each sub‑project’s maintainers are identified in [MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md). New maintainers are added via PRs after nomination and consensus, following [GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/kyverno/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md); emeritus maintainers are removed following processes also documented there.

Maturity of sub-projects seems to be indicated via semantic versioning of releases. For example, chainsaw released v0.2.14 in December 2025 and kyverno-json released v0.0.3 in May 2024.
