# General Technical Review - Kyverno / Graduation

- **Project:** Kyverno
- **Review target:** CNCF Graduation (application: [cncf/toc#1967](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1967))
- **Project version (review basis):** Kyverno docs currently published for **v1.16.0** 
- **Website:** https://kyverno.io
- **Date Updated:** 2026-02-02
- **Template Version:** v1.0
- **Description:** Kyverno is a Kubernetes-native policy engine that applies policies at admission time and via background processing (validation, mutation, generation, image verification, reporting, cleanup).

This is a living technical review draft based on publicly available sources (docs, repos, and the Graduation application issue). Any gaps are marked as **TODO** for follow-up.

## Day 0 - Planning Phase

### Scope

- **Roadmap / planning process**
  - Primary planning artifacts appear to be maintained in GitHub with design proposals (KDPs) and release notes.
  - Regular community cadence is documented via community meeting notes/schedule.

- **Target personas / how they use Kyverno**
  - Platform engineers / cluster operators author and apply policies as YAML CRDs, typically via GitOps.
  - Security and compliance teams consume outcomes via policy reports and higher-level UIs (notably Policy Reporter).

- **Primary and additional use cases**
  - Primary: enforce and validate Kubernetes policy at admission (and optionally audit in background).
  - Additional: reporting and UI integrations through **Policy Reporter (Stable)** and a **Backstage plugin (Beta)**.

- **Unsupported / out-of-scope use cases**
  - Kyverno is not a general-purpose “run policies on arbitrary JSON anywhere” solution in core; the out-of-cluster JSON mode is a **deprecated** subproject (**Kyverno JSON**).
  - TODO: confirm the project’s explicit “non-goals” list (if any) beyond subproject statements.

- **Intended organizations**
  - Any Kubernetes adopters wanting policy-as-code (security posture, best-practice enforcement, compliance controls), including regulated industries. The sample policy library targets broad real-world use.

- **End user research**
  - TODO: request links to formal UX/user research reports, surveys, or adopter interviews (if maintained publicly or shareable).

### Usability

- **Interaction model**
  - Users interact via Kubernetes CRDs (policies) and standard tooling (kubectl/GitOps). Policy testing is supported via CLI-based workflows.
  - Kyverno dynamically manages admission webhooks based on installed policies; policy shape affects runtime cost and webhook behavior.

- **UX / UI**
  - Core UX is “Kubernetes-native” (YAML + CI testing + GitOps). UI is mostly via add-ons like **Policy Reporter (Stable)** and its ecosystem integrations.

- **Production integration**
  - Integrates with cluster lifecycle tooling via Helm/YAML install, policy libraries, and observability backends via Prometheus/OpenTelemetry.

### Design

- **Design principles**
  - Kubernetes-native CRDs + controllers; policy-as-code with admission control and background reconciliation patterns.

- **Architecture expectations by environment**
  - PoC/dev: single replica and minimal policies can be sufficient.
  - Production: requires performance sizing around policy match scope and admission volume; wildcard matching policies can dramatically increase load.
  - HA: multiple replicas and controller-specific scaling patterns are documented.

- **In-cluster dependencies**
  - Requires the Kubernetes API server (admission requests + CRDs) and etcd storage for Kyverno-managed resources (including reports). No external database is required by default.
  - Some features may call external services (for example, image verification against registries and transparency logs), depending on user configuration.

- **Identity & Access Management**
  - Uses Kubernetes RBAC (service accounts/roles) for controller access. The project has reduced overly broad wildcard RBAC defaults in prior upgrades (documented as breaking/security-related change).

- **Sovereignty**
  - Default posture is “in-cluster control plane component” with no required SaaS dependency; outbound calls are feature/config-dependent (example: image verification).

- **Compliance considerations**
  - Kyverno is a mechanism to implement compliance controls; sample policies demonstrate common best-practice/compliance patterns.

- **High availability**
  - HA guidance covers controller replica strategies and operational requirements.

- **Resource and storage requirements**
  - Resource needs depend strongly on policy match scope and admission volume; wildcard policies and broad matches can create high CPU/latency pressure.
  - Policy reports can increase etcd footprint; scaling guidance includes report controller scale testing and etcd size impacts.

- **API design and release process**
  - Kyverno extends Kubernetes via CRDs and supports versioned releases with documented cadence and support expectations (including Kubernetes compatibility policy).
  - TODO: capture a concise list of “core CRDs/APIs” and stability policy per API group (if there is a single authoritative page).

### Installation

- **How Kyverno is installed/initialized**
  - Supported via Helm chart or manifests; installation creates controllers, CRDs, and admission webhooks.
  - Default failure behavior has changed over time; docs note “fail closed” by default in newer Helm chart versions.

- **How adopters validate installation**
  - Verify deployments are ready and webhooks registered; apply a known-safe sample policy and confirm expected admission or reports.
  - Policy behavior can be tested in CI using Kyverno CLI workflows.

### Security

- **Security self assessment**
  - CNCF TAG-Security self-assessment is published. See: [Kyverno security self-assessment](https://tag-security.cncf.io/community/assessments/projects/kyverno/self-assessment/).

- **Security posture vs. cloud native tenets**
  - Kyverno is a control-plane admission component that leans on Kubernetes identity (RBAC) and declarative configuration; security controls depend on policy definitions and operational defaults.

- **Security defaults and how to change them**
  - Installation docs highlight failure-policy behaviors and operational tradeoffs; operators can tune these via chart/config settings.
  - Prior upgrades document security-driven default changes (example: policy exceptions namespace scoping).

- **Security hygiene (process + evidence)**
  - Published security documentation includes SBOM guidance and supply chain verification details.
  - Third-party security audits are referenced on Kyverno’s security docs and in the Graduation application.
  - Kyverno also documents SLSA-focused build provenance work publicly.

- **Threat modeling and minimal privileges**
  - RBAC guidance and changes suggest active review of privilege minimization over time.
  - TODO: request a consolidated threat model (or pointer to one) if maintained outside the self-assessment.

- **Certificate rotation**
  - TODO: link the definitive doc section describing webhook cert issuance/rotation and operational guidance (if separate from general docs).

- **Secure software supply chain**
  - Kyverno security docs describe signatures and SBOM publication per release.
  - Public artifacts and provenance efforts are described in SLSA materials.

## Day 1 - Installation and Deployment Phase

### Project Installation and Configuration

- Typical deployment is a Helm release with configurable replicas/resources; policy management is through CRDs and GitOps workflows.
- Configuration must be sized to workload: broad policy matches can increase admission traffic and controller load.

### Project Enablement and Rollback

- Enablement is primarily “install Kyverno + apply policies”; disablement is “remove policies and/or uninstall Kyverno.”
- Uninstall guidance exists and includes cleanup considerations (webhooks, CRDs).
- TODO: clarify recommended “temporary disable” patterns for production incidents (for example, scale to zero vs. change failure behavior vs. selective policy disable).

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

- **Compatibility and cadence**
  - Kyverno documents Kubernetes compatibility expectations (N-2 style policy) and release process guidance.
- **Upgrades**
  - Upgrades require more than image tag bumps due to CRD/resource changes; documentation emphasizes reading release notes and outlines Helm/YAML upgrade patterns.
- **Rollback**
  - Helm rollback should work for many cases, but CRD changes can be a hard constraint; operators need clear downgrade guidance per release.
  - TODO: request explicit “supported downgrade matrix” and a tested upgrade→downgrade→upgrade story across recent minors.
- **How rollout/rollback can fail**
  - Primary operational risks: admission webhook timeouts/latency and failure-policy tradeoffs; troubleshooting guidance exists.
- **Rollback metrics**
  - Admission latency and request volume metrics are available; operators can monitor these plus controller errors/drops.
- **Alpha/beta capabilities**
  - Subprojects have clear maturity markers: **Authz Server (Alpha)**, **Chainsaw (Beta)**, **Policy Reporter (Stable)**, **Backstage plugin (Beta)**, **Kyverno JSON (Deprecated)**.

## Day 2 - Day-to-Day Operations Phase

### Scalability/Reliability

- Scaling is explicitly documented as both vertical and horizontal; workload and policy design are the main drivers of resource use.
- Kyverno provides load-testing assets and shares scale test methodology/results (k6-based).
- Reliability depends on admission path behavior and failure settings; “fail closed” defaults and tuning are described in install docs.
- TODO: capture formal SLOs/SLIs (if the project has published targets) and map them to existing metrics.

### Observability Requirements

- Metrics: extensive Prometheus metrics are documented, and a Grafana dashboard is provided.
- Tracing: OpenTelemetry support and tracing docs/tutorials are available.
- Logs: operators rely on controller logs plus Kubernetes events/reports; troubleshooting guidance is provided.
- Determining “in use” and “working”
  - Monitor admission request counts/latency plus policy execution metrics; validate expected PolicyReport/ClusterPolicyReport outcomes (via ecosystem tools like Policy Reporter).
- TODO: document recommended alerting thresholds (latency/error/drops) and provide reference dashboards/runbooks.

### Dependencies

- In-cluster hard dependency: Kubernetes API server + etcd (CRDs, webhooks, report objects).
- Supply chain dependencies: SBOMs are published per release; provenance/signing practices are documented.
- TODO: document dependency lifecycle/SCA workflow end-to-end (tooling, tracking, SLAs for vulnerability remediation) beyond SBOM publication.

### Troubleshooting

- Operational troubleshooting guides exist (timeouts, webhook issues, controller behavior).
- Recovery behavior is tightly coupled to admission webhook settings and controller availability.
  - TODO: summarize “safe-mode” recommendations for production incidents (preferred steps, expected blast radius) from maintainer guidance.

### Compliance

- Licensing/attribution baseline: project is open source with published artifacts and SBOMs per release.
- TODO: provide explicit process for third-party notices in source and in distributed artifacts (and how it aligns with CNCF attribution guidance).

### Security

- Access control relies on Kubernetes RBAC; privilege reduction is reflected in upgrade notes.
- Security reporting / response processes should be anchored in SECURITY.md and community governance.
  - TODO: link the current security response process (reporting, triage, rotation) and evidence of diverse representation in the response team.

## Key risks / open questions

- **Downgrade clarity:** CRD evolution can block rollbacks
    - TODO: need explicit downgrade support policy and tested paths.
- **Operational targets:** SLOs/SLIs and recommended alert thresholds are not clearly consolidated in docs. 
    - TODO: request published targets and runbooks.
- **Dependency/SCA lifecycle:** beyond SBOM publication, document how SCA is tracked and acted on. 
    - TODO: request process details
- **End user research:** 
    - TODO: request adopters list, surveys, or UX research artifacts supporting usability claims.
- **Incident “safe mode”:** 
    - TODO: confirm best-practice steps for temporarily reducing admission impact (without creating unsafe gaps).
