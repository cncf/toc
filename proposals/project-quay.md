*Name of project:* Project Quay

*Description*

Red Hat Quay is a trusted, open source registry platform for efficiently managing containerized content across global data centers, focusing on cloud-native and DevSecOps development models and environments. With long-term experience running Quay at scale, Red Hat continuously ships innovative features targeting enterprise customers

Through this community Project Quay will advance the state of the art for container image management, distribution and security scanning.  We believe that a registry can provide substantially more value to a cloud native architecture than simply storing container images.  With Project Quay we aim to develop the next generation of container image and artifact management solutions for ensuring safe, secure and efficient cloud native architectures based upon containerized technologies.

*Statement on alignment with CNCF mission*:

Project Quay would enhance the larger CNCF ecosystem by providing enterprise-class container management functionality which is fundamental to a cloud-native architecture.  A centralized image registry is a core component of large scale Kubernetes architectures.

*Release methodology and mechanics*

Project Quay releases every three weeks in conjunction with completed sprints.  Each Project Quay release is versioned with the sprint codename as defined by the Project Quay development community.  Issues are tracked for Project Quay via a public JIRA board and assigned to sprints based on priority by the Maintainers.  In the spirit of open source commitment, Red Hat also uses this JIRA board for downstream product development as well.
Each release is considered an independent version of Project Quay and compatibility guarantees across versions are not explicitly made.
