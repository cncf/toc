## Recap: What is LitmusChaos

### What is LitmusChaos ?

LitmusChaos is a chaos engineering framework for Kubernetes. The  project aims to provide a complete Chaos Engineering platform to help developers and SREs to carry out chaos experiments easily and as defined by the [principles of chaos](https://principlesofchaos.org/) . It has “cloud-native chaos” as its fundamental design goal and keeps the community at the center for growing the chaos experiments via the ChaosHub. Litmus supports common practices and aids needed in the practice of chaos, including blast radius control, steady-state definition & hypothesis validation, simulation of real-world scenarios, ability to schedule/automate experiments and observability hooks via events and prometheus metrics.

At a high level, Litmus comprises of:

Chaos Control Plane: A centralized chaos management tool called chaos-center, which helps construct, schedule and visualize chaos. The control plane is made up of a graphql server, react-based web-ui/dashboard and mongodb to store chaos data.

Chaos Execution Plane: Made up of a chaos agent or subscriber, multiple operators and a chaos exporter that execute & monitor the experiment within a defined target Kubernetes environment.

ChaosHub: An open-catalog of ready-to-use chaos/fault templates for Kubernetes and cloud platforms. The public chaoshub maintained by the Litmus project is also “embedded” into the chaos-center to aid in picking the right faults as part of a chaos workflow.

### What are the use cases?

LitmusChaos is predominantly used by the following persona:

-   Developers: To run chaos experiments during application development as part of extended devtests.
    
-   DevOps Engineers: To run chaos as a pipeline stage to find bugs when the application is subjected to fail paths as part of e2e validation in CI/CD
    
-   SREs: To plan and schedule chaos experiments into applications and/or supporting infrastructure in staging/pre-prod environments during gamedays or as part of a randomized / continuous background chaos service.

### Litmus 2.0

When we started the Litmus project, the goal of this project was to create a complete platform to practice chaos engineering at scale in a Kubernetes way. Of course this had to be done incrementally, first create a toolset for chaos injection and then add additional features to make it a platform. Litmus 1.x achieved the goal of keeping it completely open source, creating a ChaosHub and creating the required CRDs, Operators and Schedulers. With Litmus 1.x, users have a working chaos engineering toolset aligned with the original goals.
Over time, the monthly cadence releases added the following features. 
- Chaos experiments become building blocks of a ChaosWorkflow, to allow users to create a larger chaos scenarios. 
- A portal to centrally visualize the chaos workflows, get chaos analytics, get the teaming in place for collaboration of chaos workflows.
- Chaos GitOps for highly scalable automation of chaos workflows. Chaos can now be trigged as a result of a change to an application. This integrates with other CD tools like ArgoCD and FluxCD
- Chaos Interleaved dashboards. A step toward open observability that is interleaved with chaos incident details

With all these features, Litmus is a comprehensive platform for chaos engineering.

**Note:** Litmus itself is composed of microservices. For 2.0, more microservices are added and the existing ones will continue to work. Litmus 2.0 is completely backward compatible. No features are deprecated. Migration path is about constructing new artifacts such as ChaosWorkflows that include the current chaos experiments in use by the users. 

## Incubation Stage Requirements

## Statement on alignment with the CNCF mission

The practice of Chaos Engineering is a necessity for achieving service reliability. Reliable application delivery and operations are very important and key to the success of technology adoption of various CNCF projects and ecosystem projects. LitmusChaos project goal is to become the toolset to measure and achieve that reliability.  Litmus extends the existing experiences of both the cloud-native developers and SREs in adding chaos tests to either CI pipelines or to their operational infrastructure. Litmus integrates with other CNCF projects such as Argo Workflows, Argo rollouts, Prometheus and Keptn to enrich the experience of cloud native communities during their efforts to run their application services reliably. LitmusChaos Hub hosts the application specific experiments and CNCF project specific experiments will find their way into the hub. CoreDNS is one such example. 

In summary, LitmusChaos project clearly aligns with CNCF mission of making the cloud native ubiquitous by being the readily usable and easily extensible toolset for measuring and enhancing the reliability of Cloud Native applications and platforms.


## Comparison with other CNCF chaos engineering projects

- Litmus is an end to end chaos framework which allows the users to practice chaos engineering as per the [principles of chaos](https://principlesofchaos.org/) by allowing them to:
  - Minimize blast radius: 
    - Through annotation checks at higher level controllers like deployments/statefulsets/daemonsets/argo rollouts) 
    - Add affect percentage of pods belonging for these controllers

  - Define Hypothesis around experiments 
    - Via Litmus probes, to define diverse steady-state conditions & SLOs (ranging from downstream service availability, prometheus metrics, kubernetes resource status etc.,) 
    - Detailed chaosresults which indicate state of experiments & verdicts based on predefined SLO

  - Simulate real world failures & Observe events
    - By providing a wide range of pod-level and node-level chaos experiments
    - Through creation of complex chaos workflows that combine multiple faults via Litmus Portal 
    - Generating chaos events for each stage of experiment execution that can be viewed as prometheus metrics

  - Aiding continuous & automated execution 
    - Through the scheduled workflows with a rich scheduling policy 

- It achieves this while providing a kubernetes native user-experience to the developers & SREs by ensuring that both the chaos intent (experiment details like fault etc.,) as well as run properties (pod scheduling policies, resource requests & limits,  experiment image properties, monitoring, cleanup) etc., are defined via Custom Resources. 

- It also satisfies the need of multi-tenant architectures & addresses security needs by providing different modes (namespaced & admin)  of operation and also by specifying a per-experiment RBAC that interested users can leverage. 

- Importantly, Litmus orchestrates both native experiments as well as any other, i.e., supports BYOC and helps to homogenize the operational flow for these.

- In other words, the focus of the project is not only around providing means to inject different chaos types/failures (for example, projects like chaos-mesh & chaos blade are more focused on providing chaos injection methodologies), but also practice chaos engineering in a wholesome way. 

### Comparisons by  community
