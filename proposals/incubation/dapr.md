# Distributed Application Runtime CNCF Proposal

## Name of project

Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr)

## Project description

The Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, microservice stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge. 

## Overview

Using Dapr you can build microservice applications using any language, any framework, and run them anywhere.

Today developers are comfortable with web + database application architectures but not with microservice application architectures which are inherently distributed. Itâ€™s hard to become a distributed systems expert, nor should they have to. Developers want to focus on business logic, while leaning on the platforms to imbue their applications with scale, resiliency, maintainability, elasticity and the other attributes of cloud-native architectures.

Dapr codifies the best practices for building microservice applications into open, independent, building blocks exposed via a consistent API that enables you to build portable applications with the language and framework of your choice. Each building block is completely independent and you can use one, some, or all of them in your application.

Dapr is platform agnostic meaning you can run your applications locally, on any Kubernetes cluster, and other hosting environments. This enables you to build microservice applications that can run on the cloud and edge.

### About Dapr

Dapr exposes its APIs as a sidecar architecture, either as a container or as a process, not requiring the application code to include any Dapr runtime code. This makes integration with Dapr easy from other runtimes, as well as providing separation of the application logic.  

Dapr can be hosted in multiple environments, including self hosted for local development, a group of VMs, and Kubernetes. Dapr has a control plane that is deployed and integrated with the hosting environment, with Kubernetes currently being the preferred choice for production workloads.  

Dapr released as a v1.0 project in Feb 2021 and has achieved the stability and enterprise readiness to be designated production ready. Dapr is used in production today by multiple companies. 

### CNCF Due Diligence (DD) document
The [Dapr CNCF Due Diligence document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GknuJk8Z26KhvFJiblbMSopWbX27nihpxkEG0_TpkCw/edit) provides the necessary details to support submission of Dapr as an Incubations project to CNCF via the App-Delivery SIG. Refer to this document to answer required questions on accepting Dapr into CNCF Incubation status.

### Features

Dapr consists of a high-performance runtime, CLI, language specific SDKs (Java, Python, Go, .NET, PHP, C++, Javascript) and pluggable components to integrate with a range of different technologies including storage, queues, event brokers etc.

Dapr has a set of [building block APIs](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/building-blocks-concept/) that use pluggable [components](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/components-concept/) to provide a developer abstraction, code portability and hosting independence. These are the building blocks that Dapr provides.

| Building Block API | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Service-to-service invocation | Resilient service-to-service invocation enables method calls, including retries, on remote services wherever they are located in the hosting environment.
| State management| State management is used for storing key/value pairs, and enables long running, highly available, stateful services.
| Publish and subscribe | Publishes events and subscribes to topics using Cloud Events, and enables scalable, event-driven services.
| Resource bindings | Resource bindings with code triggers enables event-driven architectures by receiving and sending events to and from any external source such as databases, queues, file systems, and services like Twitter, Twilio etc.
| Actors | A pattern for stateful and stateless objects that makes concurrency simple with method and state encapsulation. Can be used to build IoT and workflow applications.
| Observability | Dapr emit metrics, logs, and traces to debug and monitor both Dapr and user applications. Distributed tracing uses W3C Trace Context and Open Telemetry supports all monitoring tools including Prometheus and Grafana. 
| Secrets | Secrets management integrates with public cloud and local secret stores to retrieve the secrets for use in application code.

The Dapr CLI provides a simple local development experience to develop, build and test cloud native applications. 

Although Dapr can be used with localhost HTTP or gRPC calls, language SDKs provide a more familar developer experience and integration with language specific tooling.

## Statement on alignment with CNCF charter mission

Dapr is aligned with the CNCF mission to make cloud native computing ubiquitous for developers. Dapr enables developers to build scalable, cloud native applications faster and  makes them portable across different clouds, bringing true multi-cloud experience to application development. Dapr is a community-led project that has an open governance charter with a large and rapidly growing community. Dapr utilizes and integrates with several existing CNCF technolgies and is an ideal fit with the cloud native serverless ecosystem which is why we are seeking to have Dapr join the CNCF.

## Comparison with similar projects (inside or outside the CNCF), including what differentiates this project

Similar projects outside of CNCF:

- **[Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro)** is a microservices framework that has some similaries to Dapr. A significant difference is that Dapr is a set of APIs that can be used from any language or framework and is incremental in its adoption. Most microservice frameworks today like Micro are restricted to certain languages, require developers to rewrite their code and do not expose a set of common APIs that can be extended by the community.

- Service meshes such as CNCF **[Linkerd](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd)** and non-CNCF **[Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio)** both have network routing, security and observability that Dapr also provides. The primary difference between Dapr and service meshes is that Dapr operates at the application level by exposing APIs for developers, whereas service meshes operate at the infrastructure networking layer.

Dapr integrates with many CNCF projects, including;

- **[CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec)** for all publish/subscribe events.
- **[gRPC](https://github.com/grpc)** for high-performance remote procedure calls (RPC).
- **[SPIFFE](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe)** for identifying and securing communications between application services.
- **[Open Telemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry)** to generate, collect, and export telemetry data.
- **[Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm)** used to deploy Dapr's control plane to Kubernetes.
- **[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus)** to collect and analyse metrics. 
- **[Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger)** for distributed tracing.
- **[NATS](https://github.com/nats-io)** as a high performance open source messaging system for cloud native applications.
- **[KEDA](https://github.com/kedacore/keda)** for fine-grained autoscaling on Kubernetes.

## Release methodology and mechanics

Dapr reached [v1.0 maturity in Feb 2021](https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/02/17/announcing-dapr-v1.0/) having worked closely with customers such as Zeiss, Ignition Group and Morgan Stanley as well as adopters such as Alibaba. 

### Milestone release plan
Each milestone release plan is tracked with an issue, for example these are the plans from the v1.0 and v1.1 releases.
- [Milestone release plan v1.0](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2346)
- [Milestone release plan v1.1](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2843) 

Each release sets dates and brings together milestones from the maintainers of each of the Dapr repos. Dapr releases on a regular cadence of around every 6 weeks. Current and next milestones for each repo are maintained. See https://github.com/dapr/dapr/milestones

### Milestone release endgame plan
Each release endgame plan is tracked with an issue, for example this is the release endgame plan for v1.0.

 - [Milestone release endgame v1.0](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2724)

The endgame tracks the steps to cut a supported release, which can go through a number of release candidates (RCs) during the endgame phase. The RCs are opportunities for users in production and community members to raise any issues that they encounter.

Dapr has a versioning policy for releases which is described in the [Versioning policy](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-versioning/) documentation.

Dapr has a rolling window of supported releases. Dapr's supported release policy is described in the [Supported releases](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-release-policy/) documentation.
