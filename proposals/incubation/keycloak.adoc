Keycloak CNCF Incubation Project Submission Proposal
----------------------------------------------------

This is a resubmission of Keycloak as Incubation project. Initially
proposed in 2018 has been impacted by Sandbox process changes and overal
lack of bandwidth in TOC. This resulted in halt of intake of new
projects. With recent changes to Sandbox definition would like to approach inclusion of Keycloak as CNCF Incubation project instead.

Goal
~~~~

Keycloak is an open source Identity and access management solution aimed
at modern applications and services. It makes it easy to secure
applications and services with little to no code.

Keycloak is based on standard protocols with an aim toward modern use
cases and the flexibility to integrate with other solutions and prevent
vendor lock in. Supported protocols include: OAuth2, OpenID Connect,
User Managed Access 2.0 (UMA) and SAML 2.0.

Single-Sign On
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users authenticate with Keycloak rather than to individual applications.
This frees developers from dealing with login forms, authenticating
users, and storing users. Keycloak provides both single sign-in and
single sign-out to different types of applications (client-side,
server-side, mobile, etc.) and protocols (OIDC and SAML2) within same
realm. It also provides Kerberos bridge to propagate authentication
(LDAP or Active Directory) from workstations to web applications via
SPNEGO.

Token based security
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Through OpenID Connect flows applications retrieve access tokens that
can be used to invoke services securely without the need to pass user
credentials. This enables easy end-to-end user authentication for
client-side applications, micro services, service mesh and other modern
architectures.

Identity Brokering and Social Login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keycloak can authenticate users using any existing external OpenID
Connect or SAML 2.0 Identity Providers by acting as a proxy and hiding
the involved complexity from applications. Leveraging these mechanisms
makes enabling authentication via social providers trivial and quick.

User Federation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keycloak has built-in support to connect to existing LDAP or Active
Directory servers, allowing custom provider implementations to connect
users in other stores, such as a relational database.

Client Adapters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keycloak client adapters make it easy to secure applications and
services by providing adapters for a number of platforms and programming
languages. Keycloak is built on standard protocols which then allows any
existing OpenID Connect Resource Library or SAML 2.0 Service Provider
library to integrate with it.

It is also possible to use a proxy adapter to secure applications, which
removes the need to modify an application at all. This can be leveraged
in Kubernetes deployment by deploying the adapter as a side car.

Admin Console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All features and aspects of Keycloak configuration can be managed via an
Admin UI, the CLI or a set of REST APIs, this includes managing users,
permissions and active SSO sessions.

Account Management Console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Through the account management console users can manage their own
accounts. They can update their user profile, change passwords, and
setup two-factor authentication. Users can also manage sessions and view
history for the account. If they have enabled social login or identity
brokering, users can also link their accounts with additional providers
to allow them to authenticate to the same account with different
identity providers.

Authorization Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keycloak provides the ability for more fine-grained authorization for
scenarios where traditional RBAC is not enough. By implementing the UMA
2 spec it allows managing resources, permissions and sophisticated
policies from the Keycloak admin console.

SPI and pluggable architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All core components in Keycloak are implemented with pluggable
architecture. Introducing new or alternative implementations of
particular capabilities or required extensions is easy. There are number
of externally hosted and maintained plugins which serve as examples to
anyone who would like to write their own or contribute to the project.

High Availability and Active-Active Cross-Data Center
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Keycloak supports traditional high availability by providing clustering.
In addition, it supports deployments of connected clusters between
geo-separated data centers. Keycloak provides both active-active and
active-passive (fallback) switching scenarios between configured data
centers.

Current Status

Project Scope
-------------

Clear project definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenSource Identity and Access Management Solution for Modern
Applications, API and Services. Aiming to make security easy for
developers. OpenID Connect Certified and SAML 2.0 compatible Identity
Provider. Also User Managed Access (UMA2) implementation.

Allowing to secure applications with minimum to no code. Providing all
typically required authentication, authorization and identity management
capabilities for applications. Allowing developers to provide strong
security into their applications without implementing typical features
like login screens, registration, user management, password policies,
figuring out how to securely issue and handle tokens and etc.

Focusing on modern standards around the OAuth2 ecosystem, while
including SAML2 support due to widespread usage. Keeping other
technologies (CAS, WS-Fed, etc.) outside of the core codebase and as
extensions.

It is an opinionated solution trying to avoid code and function creep.
Aiming to remain fairly lightweight. Delivering on 80/20 principle.
Focusing on Cloud Native and modern use cases.

Value-add to the Cloud Native Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Security is a cornerstone of Cloud Native deployments and the OAuth2
family of standards like OpenID Connect has become a default choice when
implementing modern applications, services, and APIs. Keycloak fits
perfectly into the cloud landscape as a lightweight and modern solution.
Embracing developers with an ease of use and and the rapid velocity of
integrating Keycloak into applications, Keycloak also embraces new
development models.

Rapid project growth and adoption has proven it has already become a
technology of choice for applications developed in Cloud Native
ecosystem.

Single Source of Truth for Cloud Identities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By centralizing identity management and allowing integration with
different identity sources (e.g.: LDAP and user-defined databases),
Keycloak can act as a single source of truth for applications as well as
to the infrastructure where these applications are deployed to.

Keycloak is already considered by some key projects such as OpenStack,
Kubernetes and OpenShift to leverage their security capabilities by
providing this single source of truth for identities accessing the
cloud. Some references:

* https://docs.openstack.org/vitrage/latest/contributor/keycloak-config.html
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#configuring-the-api-server

Alignment with other CNCF projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenID Connect, OAuth2 and JWT are standards leveraged by all Cloud
Native technologies nowadays.

Kubernetes Official Documentation for authentication points to Keycloak
as one of possible OpenID Connect Providers to leverage
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/

OIDC is embraced for end user authentication by service mesh
technologies.

Keycloak provides a standalone adapter called Gatekeeper allowing
securing applications via sidecar. Instrumenting security rules without
changing application codebase.
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-gatekeeper

Anticipated use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Standalone Identity Provider (OpenID Connect, SAML 2.0)

Standalone Authorization Server (OAuth 2.0)

Central Authorization solution (User Managed Access - UMA 2.0). * Policy
Evaluation Point, custom, chained policies (ABAC, Rules, JavaScript,
etc.)

Offloading application from implementing typical capabilities by
providing integrations and set of hosted screens and services which can
be themed/skinned to look like an integral part of application *
Security (auth/authz) * Identity and Access Management capabilities
(User/Role/Attribute management, password policies, etc.) *
Authentication / Registration capabilities * Modern authentication
capabilities (W3C WebAuthN, MFA) * User Self Service (changing profile,
password, registering authentication tokens, sessions and consent
management)

Shields developer from legacy or custom infrastructure integrations
which can be plugged in and leveraged while being hidden from
application. Allowing developers to develop using modern protocols
(OpenID Connect/OAuth 2.0) while still delivering on traditional
integration needs * Flexible LDAP and Kerberos (SPNEGO) integration *
Custom User Storage implementations * Social Login Providers (Sign in
via FB, Google, Github, Twitter, etc) with flexible attribute mapping *
External Identity Providers (SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, custom)

Formal Requirements
-------------------

Keycloak project is able to meet all requirements. Already has proper
governance model, is ready to adopt CNCF Code of Conduct and perform
required trademark transfer. Will adhere to the CNCF IP Policy

Has the TOC been approached for sponsorship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keycloak has approached Sandbox submission in the past although this has
been impacted with process changes. At the point Keycloak submitted CNCF
TOC decided to halt intake of new projects and redesign the whole
process. This essentially derailed previous submission. During second attempt definition of Sandbox changed which lead project to switch aiming Incubation

Cloud Native
------------

The Keycloak team believes that this project aligns well with section
1(c) of the CNCF Charter by providing a standard and simple way to
secure Cloud Native applications and services. Out of the box, Keycloak
provides an extensive set of features such as user federation, admin
console and account management console. Securing applications and
services can be done with only a few lines of code through Keycloak
adapters that are provided for a range of languages and frameworks.
Keycloak also provides both OpenID Connect and SAML 2.0 enabling any
application that have support for either to be easily secured. Keycloak
already has wide community support. Bringing Keycloak into the CNCF, the
team hopes to continue to expand the list of features, making it even
easier to secure different types of applications and reach an even wider
community interested in contribution and adoption.
