== Argo Proposal

*Name of project*: Argo

*Description*:

The Argo Project is a set of Kubernetes-native tools for deploying and running jobs and applications on Kubernetes. All the Argo tools are implemented as controllers and custom resources. These tools can be used independently but are even more powerful when used together. As a CNCF incubation project, all top level projects  must meet incubation maturity requirements.

*Argo Workflows* enables creation of complex parallel workflows as Kubernetes resources and is used in many different use cases from CI/CD pipelines to DAG-based ML training workflows. It is the workflow engine behind the open source Kubeflow Pipelines.

*Argo Events* provides declarative management of event-based dependencies and triggers for Kubernetes resources based on various event sources. A common use of Argo Events is to trigger Argo Workflows and to generate events for long-lived services deployed using Argo CD.

*Argo CD* supports declarative GitOps-based deployment of any Kubernetes resource, including Argo Events, services and deployments across multiple k8s clusters.

Each of these tools is built to be Kubernetes native and are implemented as controllers and Custom Resources.  These tools can be used independently, but there is great benefit in using them together to create complex applications. Argo Events, for example, can kick off Argo Workflows which can generate and queue additional Argo Events which are processed by long-lived services deployed using Argo CD.

Different Argo tools have been presented at Kubernetes community meetings and KubeCon conferences.

*Statement on alignment with CNCF mission*:

The Argo project is well-aligned with the CNCFâ€™s mission to make cloud native computing ubiquitous. We are completely aligned to "empower organizations to build and run scalable applications" including the adoption of Kubernetes and declarative APIs. All the Argo tools are implemented as controllers and custom resources. They use/integrate with other CNCF projects like gRPC, Prometheus, NATS, Helm..
