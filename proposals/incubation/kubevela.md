# KubeVela proposal for CNCF Incubation

## About KubeVela

[KubeVela](https://kubevela.io/) is a modern software delivery control plane. The goal is to make deploying and operating applications across today's hybrid, multi-cloud environments easier, faster and more reliable. Applications created with KubeVela use the best practices of modern applications by default: they are able to scale with clouds, they use infrastructure as code, they are observable and secure.

Currently, KubeVela primarily provides the following key features:

* **Deployment as Code**: KubeVela declares your deployment plan as [workflow](https://kubevela.io/docs/getting-started/core-concept), run it automatically with any CI/CD or GitOps system, extend or re-program the workflow steps with CUE. It can glue and orchestrate all of your IaC based infrastructure capabilities as reusable modules, share with the community as [addons](https://kubevela.net/docs/reference/addons/overview). The deployment workflow in KubeVela is powered by [Open Application Model](https://oam.dev/).

* **Built-in security, compliance and observability building blocks**: Users can choose from the wide range of LDAP integrations provided out-of-box, enjoy enhanced [multi-cluster authorization and authentication](https://kubevela.io/docs/platform-engineers/auth/advance), pick and apply fine-grained RBAC modules and customize them per their own supply chain requirements. All delivery process has fully automated observability.

* **Multi-cloud/hybrid-environments app delivery as first-class citizen**: KubeVela natively supports multi-cluster/hybrid-cloud scenarios such as progressive rollout across test/staging/production environments, automatic canary, blue-green and continuous verification, rich placement strategy across clusters and clouds, along with automated cloud environments provision.


KubeVela was accepted as a CNCF Sandbox project on June 22, 2021.

### Governance

The KubeVela community has matured significantly. We have established [the community membership roadmap](https://github.com/kubevela/community/blob/main/community-membership.md), and quite a few active and qualified contributors
have been promoted to approvers and maintainers. Currently, we have 6 maintainers and 8 approvers from 7 organizations.

We host weekly contributors and community meetings. We codified our [contributing guidelines](https://kubevela.io/docs/contributor/overview#contribution-guide), and [security processes](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

### Technology

We have significantly expanded the covered technical areas for the project development since KubeVela joined the Sandbox.
Currently, KubeVela has made feature developments in at least the following technical areas:
- **Multi-Cluster Delivery**: we have developed a project called [cluster-gateway](https://github.com/oam-dev/cluster-gateway) for routing kubernetes api traffic to multiple kubernetes clusters. It can support direct connect clusters using kubeconfig as secret, or integrate with [Open-Cluster-Management(OCM)](https://open-cluster-management.io/). As a result, the application layer of KubeVela shares the same interface no matter the underlying implementation.
- **Cloud Resource Delivery**: KubeVela natively support Crossplane for cloud resource provisioning, we have also developed a project called [terraform-controller](https://github.com/kubevela/terraform-controller) to make terraform-based cloud resource delivery available with Kubernetes CRD API. As a result, KubeVela can provide a wide range of cloud resources that supported by both Crossplane and Terraform ecosystem.
- **Lightweight App Delivery**: we have developed [velad](https://github.com/kubevela/velad) to provide lightweight KubeVela integrated with [K3s](https://k3s.io/) that can run in a single node with high availability. It can help local development or work as a lightweight control plane for multi-cluster/hybrid cloud app distribution.
- **UI Console**: we have built an end-to-end [UI console](https://github.com/kubevela/velaux) to help new users to quickly learn all features provided by KubeVela. It also help end users to adopt KubeVela easily as an out-of-box application platform.
- **Addon Ecosystem**: we have developed an addon ecosystem that can be used to extend the functionality of KubeVela. There's a growing catalog of addons available in [this repo](https://github.com/kubevela/catalog) including lots of CNCF projects.

## Statement on Alignment with the CNCF Mission

The cloud-native ecosystem has been growing very fast, while modeling the deployment of a microservice application on top of cloud-native technology is a highly fragmented and challenging process. KubeVela aims to make deploying and operating applications across today's hybrid, multi-cloud environments easier, faster and more reliable. It will not only simplify the application delivery experience, while also be flexible enough to satisfy the fast growth of businesses requirements.

We believe it strictly aligns with the mission of CNCF in empowering organizations to build and run applications in modern cloud-native environments and benefit from the large growing cloud native technologies.


## Future plan

We are running our project in a fairly open model so that we can react to the needs of our community promptly. We are used to using [github millstone](https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/milestone/9) to dynamically manage the issues on the plan.

There are still quite a few critical and high demanding features that are under development, including but not limited to the following:

- Improve the user experience for cloud resource provisioning and consuming with delivery workflow.
- Enhance the security for the whole CI/CD delivery process in hybrid/multi-cluster scenario.
- Provide user defined observability with more automation.

 In addition, we have [roadmap](https://kubevela.io/docs/roadmap/) page on the doc site so that the community members can easily track where we are going in a wider perspective.
