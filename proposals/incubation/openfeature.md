## Overview

OpenFeature is an open standard for feature flag management, created to support a robust feature flag ecosystem using cloud native technologies. OpenFeature provides a unified API and SDK, and a developer-first, cloud-native implementation, with extensibility for open source and commercial offerings.

## Sponsors from the TOC

The OpenFeature project is currently looking for a TOC sponsor

## Progress Since Sandbox

### Community

**Outreach:** As a project we hold regular community meetings each month, highlighting what is happening in the community with presentations from multiple adopters and discussions on current topics and interests in the community. Community sessions have on average **12 attendees**, are uploaded to a [Project meeting playlist hosted on Youtube](<[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dV3aZo6JN8&list=PLf1KFlSkDLIBmA5TLXn2BzEHmwWzckP8y](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiQt8D1ofl8zR0u5kzFjrX_U4rGteyOVa)>) and gained **over 750 views**.

## Incubation Stage Requirements

### **_Adhere to CNCF [IP Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#11-ip-policy)_**

As an existing Sandbox project this is already in place

### **_Document that it is being used successfully in production by at least three independent end users which, in the TOCâ€™s judgement, are of adequate quality and scope_**

### **_Clear versioning scheme & release methodology_**

### **_Demonstrate a substantial ongoing flow of commits and merged contributions._**

### **_Security_**

## Statement on Alignment with the CNCF Mission

OpenFeature provides a standardized, vendor-neutral specification and tooling for feature flagging.
Feature flags are becoming an essential aspect of the modern software development lifecycle because they allow teams to make decouple deployments from feature releases.
This reduces many risks associated with traditional deployments, allowing engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably.

Standardizing feature flags unlocks increased observability at the feature level, providing additional pathways for increased automation, including intelligent deployment and rollback orchestration.
This aligns with the [CNCF mission](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation) of democratizing state-of-the-art patterns, making innovations in feature flagging, feature observability, and intelligent deployments accessible to everyone.
