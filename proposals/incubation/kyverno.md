## Background

- [Incubation presentation to CNCF TAG Security - 13th April 2022](https://youtu.be/ko_T_fiA_1s?t=2297), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CDgQKnGGb0Rck88CrqURYvNWIT3dUdx_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112353473651856718940&rtpof=true&sd=true)


Kubernetes has a declarative configuration management system that allows users to specify the desired state of resources which Kubernetes controllers continuously reconcile with the current system state. Kyverno uses Kubernetes custom resource definitions for cluster-wide and namespaced policies, and the [Kubernetes Policy WG policy report](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/wg-policy-prototypes/tree/master/policy-report) for reporting policy results.

Kyverno was accepted as a CNCF Sandbox project on [November 9th, 2020](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nnh_usr0tSZxaUpxTusqeIqKxMmvuEViRkyO9e_Do40/edit#gid=1136111842).

## About Kyverno

Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. With Kyverno, policies are managed as Kubernetes resources and no new language is required to write policies. This allows using familiar tools such as `kubectl`, `git`, and `kustomize` to manage policies. Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources in addition to verifying container image supply chain security via signing verification and attestations. The Kyverno CLI can be used to test policies and validate resources as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

### High-level Architecture

Kyverno comprises four major components with each described below:

<img src="https://kyverno.io/images/kyverno-architecture.png" alt="Kyverno Architecture" width="80%"/>
</br></br>

**Webhook**: The Webhook component registers as a validating and mutating admission webhook and receives AdmissionReview requests from the API server to validate and mutate configuration changes, based on policies. Users can configure which namespaces and resources the webhooks will receive via command line options or the ConfigMap.

The Webhook also creates and updates `GenerateRequest` and `ReportChangeRequest` resources to trigger updates via other Kyverno controllers.

**Webhook Monitor**: On startup, Kyverno's Webhook Monitor component generates a self-signed certificate (or uses a user-provided certificate) and auto-creates the webhook configurations required to register Kyverno as an admission webhook. The component also periodically monitors if Kyverno is receiving webhook events and recreates the certificate and webhook configurations if needed.

**Generate Controller**: The Generate Controller watches `GenerateRequest` resources and creates, updates, and deletes Kubernetes resources based on Kyverno [generate rules](https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/generate/). The Generate Controller also watches for changes in policy definitions to update generated resources.

**Policy Controller**: The Policy Controller performs periodic background scans on existing configurations and creates or updates policy reports based on changes and background scans. The Policy Controller watches `ReportChangeRequest` resources and creates, updates, and delete Kyverno [Policy Report](https://kyverno.io/docs/policy-reports/) resources. The Policy Controller also watches for changes in policy definitions to update policy reports.

**_A clear versioning scheme._**

Kyverno uses the [Semantic Versioning scheme](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver). Kyverno v1.0.0 was released in Dec 2019. This project follows a given version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Details can be found [here](https://main.kyverno.io/docs/release-management/#versioning).

## Statement on Alignment with the CNCF Mission

A recent [CNCF security survey](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2021/10/12/cloud-native-security-microsurvey-more-than-80-of-organizations-want-to-build-modern-security-systems-with-open-source-software/) revealed that more than 80% of organizations are looking for modern security systems with open source software. Kyverno's goal is to help address and close this gap. Kyverno secures and automates Kubernetes configurations by providing a powerful but easy-to-use policy engine that allows developers, operators, and security engineers to leverage policies as contracts for collaboration. By making Kubernetes easier to use and secure, Kyverno's mission directly aligns with the Foundations mission of making cloud native ubiquitious.

## Comparison with Other CNCF Policy Management Projects

### Comparison to OPA/Gatekeeper

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is a general-purpose policy engine where policies are defined using Rego. [Gatekeeper]([OPA/Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/) enables OPA/Rego policies to be used in Kubernetes and allows customization of Rego policies using constraints.

Kyverno was designed for Kubernetes and its policies leverage the OpenAPIv3 structural schema used for Kubernetes resources. In addition, Kyverno uses Kubernetes patterns, idioms, and best practices, so it feels familiar to Kubernetes DevSecOps teams. Kyverno policies—and policy results—are custom resources that can be managed using the same declarative configuration management principles used in Kubernetes and by widely adopted tools like kubectl and Kustomize. 

Here is a video and blog published by members of the community which compares policy management tools for Kubernetes:
- [Kubernetes Policy Management Tools Compared - OPA with Gatekeeper vs. Kyverno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gSrRNmmKBc&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=DevOpsToolkit), by Viktor Farcic
- [Kubernetes Policy Comparison: OPA/Gatekeeper vs Kyverno](https://neonmirrors.net/post/2021-02/kubernetes-policy-comparison-opa-gatekeeper-vs-kyverno/), by Chip Zoller

## Roadmap

Kyverno maintains a steady pace of releases driven by a growing set of requirements and use cases. The planned releases can be viewed using the issue [milestones](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open). 

Some longer term features may include:
- Flexible deployment models for Kyverno beyond admission controls
- Adopting Common Expressions Language (CEL), or similar processors
- Expansion of use cases for applications security and automation
- SLSA Level 3 compliance for build security
