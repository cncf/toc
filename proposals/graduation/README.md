# Graduation Proposals

Projects looking to graduate from the incubation stage can submit a
[Pull Request](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pulls) that includes a new file
`proposals/graduation/NAME.md` (where `NAME` is the name of the project such
that spaces are replace with dashes (`-`)) based on the
[graduation template file](../../process/graduation-proposal-template.md).

Once the PR is submitted the following process will be followed:
- TOC, TAG or other members of the CNCF may comment on the PR to ask for
  additional information or clarifications.
- Once all open comments have been addressed and at least 6 TOC members
  have `LTGM` (approved) the PR (and no one has `NOT LGTM`d the PR), 
  the author of the PR should ping `@amye` to ask for the PR to be
  scheduled for review during an upcoming TOC call.
