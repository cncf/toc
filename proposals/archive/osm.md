# Open Service Mesh Archiving Review

The OSM team recently made an announcement on the project blog site [updating the community on the OSM project](https://openservicemesh.io/blog/osm-project-update/). In short, the OSM maintainers feel resources and time are better served collaborating with the Istio project to accelerate a common and shared agenda on service mesh feature focus.

The OSM team is recommending the OSM project to be archived.

As per the [CNCF Project Archiving Process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/archiving.md), this archival proposal is now being PRed to the TOC repo.
