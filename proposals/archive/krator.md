# Krator Archiving Review

The Krator maintainers have moved on to other projects and professional obligations. No further work has happened since August 2022, and the Krator maintainers are recommending the project for archival at this time.

As per the [CNCF Project Archiving Process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/archiving.md), this archival proposal is now being PRed to the TOC repo.
