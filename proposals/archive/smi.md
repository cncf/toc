# Service Mesh Interface Archiving Review

In July 2022, the SMI team updated the project blog site: [Announcing SMI's collaboration in the Gateway API GAMMA Initiative](https://smi-spec.io/blog/announcing-smi-gateway-api-gamma/). The SMI maintainers have since focused on approaching [service mesh under the auspices of the GAMMA project](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/29/gateway-api-v0-8/), as part of SIG Network. No further work has happened under the SMI umbrella, and the SMI maintainers are recommending the SMI project for archival at this time.

As per the [CNCF Project Archiving Process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/archiving.md), this archival proposal is now being PRed to the TOC repo.
