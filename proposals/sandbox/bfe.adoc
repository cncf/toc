## BFE Project Proposal

### Name of Project: 
BFE

### Description: 
BFE is an open-source layer 7 load balancer derived from proprietary Baidu FrontEnd. Its features and advantages include:

- **Written in Golang**: BFE is written in a memory safety language and immune to Buffer Overflow vulnerability; BFE recovers from the runtime panics and handles them appropriately without killing the BFE process; BFE runs on Linux, Windows, Mac OS and almost anything to which Go compiles.

- **Flexible plugin framework**: BFE has a builtin plugin framework that makes it possible to develop new features rapidly by writing plugins.

- **Multi-tenancy architecture**: BFE is designed to provide every tenant a dedicated share of the instance. Each tenant’s configuration is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.

- **Multiple protocols supported**: BFE supports HTTP, HTTPS, SPDY, HTTP2, WebSocket, TLS, etc. Future support is planned for gRPC and HTTP/3.

- **Content based routing**: BFE provides an advanced domain-specific language to describe routing rules which are easy to understand and maintain.

- **Advanced load balancing**: BFE supports global load balancing and distributed load balancing for zone aware balancing, zone level failure resilience, overload protection etc.

- **A rich set of builtin plugins**: BFE provides a rich set of plugins for traffic management, security, observability, etc.

- **Best-in-class observability**: BFE includes detailed built-in metrics for all subsystems. BFE writes various logs(server log/access log/TLS key log) for trouble shooting, data analysis and visualization. BFE also supports distributed tracing.

- **Easily integrated with ecosystem projects**: BFE is easily integrated with mainstream layer 4 load balancing solution, and other ecosystem projects(e.g. Kubernetes、Prometheus、Jaeger、Fluentd etc).

### Why is BFE a good fit for CNCF?
Load balancing is one of the most important components of any cloud-native infrastructure platform, and end users need a range of choices to meet their needs. BFE is complementary to existing CNCF reverseproxy projects like Envoy, which is currently the only reverseproxy option hosted by CNCF. As a edge load balancer, BFE serves as another choice for cloud-native applications that need flexible, security, high availability, and scalability.

With BFE becoming a CNCF project, the open-source cloud-native ecosystem will also become more vibrant and robust in China, because our team has a strong track record of fostering the open source community in China and is dedicated to building and promoting CNCF’s mission there. Open source is global, and having BFE as a part of CNCF will further make that story so.

### BFE Overview
 * Development Timeline:
   * Current release: 0.9.0
   * Jul 31, 2019: BFE was open-sourced

### Cloud-Native Features of BFE
 * Horizontal scalability: BFE enables elastic capacity scaling by simply adding or removing nodes with no interruption to ongoing workloads.
 * Auto-failover and self-healing: BFE supports automatic failover, so in situations of software or hardware failures, the system will automatically recover while maintaining the applications’ availability.
 * Cloud-native deployment: BFE can be deployed in any cloud environment--public, private, or hybrid--.

## Statement on Alignment with CNCF Mission

Our team believes BFE will be a great fit for CNCF. As the CNCF’s mission is to “create and drive the adoption of a new computing paradigm that is optimized for modern distributed systems environments capable of scaling to tens of thousands of self healing multi-tenant nodes,” we believe BFE to be a core enabling technology for this mission. This belief has been validated by our many adopters and developers working to build, deploy, and maintain large-scale applications in a cloud-native environment. Moreover, BFE has very strong existing synergy with other CNCF projects, and is used heavily in conjunction with projects like: Kubernetes, Prometheus, Jaeger、Fluentd and gRPC.
