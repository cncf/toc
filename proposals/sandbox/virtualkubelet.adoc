== Virtual Kubelet

*Name of project*: Virtual Kubelet

*Description*:

Virtual Kubelet(VK) is an implementation of the Kubernetes kubelet which masquerades as a node for the purposes of extending the Kubernetes node API to other services. 
VKâ€™s primary focus is for serverless services such as Azure ACI, AWS Fargate, Hyper.sh, and others where these services can be treated like any other node in a Kubernetes cluster. 
It should be noted that VK is explicitly not intended to be an alternative to Kubernetes federation.

*Statement on alignment with CNCF mission*:

Virtual Kubelet works within the Kubernetes ecosystem rather than being a replacement architecture
but it is also are a standalone component that can be easily installed or deleted. Virtual Kubelet truly enables people to 
extend beyond the lines of a traditional node. The VK community is growing with over 50 contributors from Microsoft, VMWare, Amazon, and more. 
Release 1.0 is expected in December.
