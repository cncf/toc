=== in-toto CNCF Incubating Project Proposal

*Name of Project:* in-toto

*Description:*

in-toto is a framework to secure software supply chains in and outside of the
cloud. 

Current cloud native deployments build software using a complex process that
is vulnerable to attack.  Building software involves a software supply chain 
comprised of version control systems, build servers, CI/CD systems, test frameworks, 
localization, etc. that must all be honest or else the software may be tampered with.  
in-toto is the first framework to provide cryptograpically
verifiable, full-system provenance of all the artifacts (e.g., source code files, 
executables, documentation, pictures, etc.) within the supply chain.  As a result,
in-toto is able to defend against malicious parties that tamper with a company's
software.

*Current CNCF Ecosystem Integrations:*

- TUF:
    * Datadog has integrated https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/secure-publication-of-datadog-agent-integrations-with-tuf-and-in-toto/[TUF and in-toto into their pipeline].
    We intend to standardize this approach as a https://github.com/in-toto/ITE/issues/3[best-practices] document within our organization.

- Kubernettes:
    * kubectl plugin: There is a kubectl plugin that you can use to scan containers running in pods to check that they pass in-toto verification. https://github.com/in-toto/kubectl-in-toto[more here]
    * Admission webhook: in-toto can also be set up as an admission controller to verify the ingress of any containers. https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-webhook[more here]

The website is currently a 301 to in-toto.github.io: https://in-toto.io[https://in-toto.io] 

Blogposts related to in-toto are currently published in NYU's secure systems's lab blog. https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/blog/[https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/blog/]


*Release Cadence:*

in-toto's release process for the reference implementation has a strict
adherence with semver. The release schedule is as follows:

* 2 months of feature develoment
* 1 one month of feature freeze
* 1 month of release candidacy

Other code repositories will follow semver as they mature. Specifications and
other repositories follow the release code published in the enhancement
documents https://github.com/in-toto/ITE[https://github.com/in-toto/ITE]


*Statement on alignment with CNCF mission:*

The cloud-native ecosystem has evolved into an incredibly rich and featureful
set of applications that are built using a complex set of tools. Ensuring
applications are built correctly and without tampering is paramount for cloud
security.  Furthermore, vulnerability scanners, static analyzers, buildfarms, code
review systems, etc. need a way to have their outcomes validated before applications
are shipped. in-toto's architecture provides cryptographically verifiable methods to 
ensure compliance and security for all tools, hence protecting cloud applications.

in-toto aligns with the CNCF mission statement by:

* being-container transparent: when designing in-toto, we considered the nature of all toolchains involved in contemporary applications. As such, in-toto can be used in and out of the cloud interchangably. Furthermore, in-toto can be used in hybrid cloud setups.
* Helping to enforce cloud native best practices: in-toto layouts are a great place to locate cloud native policy information. With it, parties can judge and verify that a project is, in-fact, running a correct process in their cloud native pipeline. Our admission webhook can be used to enforce the admission of pods, daemonsets and statefulsets that strictly followed the layout assigned to them.
