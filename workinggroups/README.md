# CNCF Working Groups

## Introduction

The purpose of working groups are to study and report on a particular question and make recommendations based on its findings. The end result of a working group may be a new project proposal, landscape, whitepaper or even a report detailing their findings. The intention of working groups is not to host a full project or specification. Working Groups can be formed at any time but must be sponsored by a TOC member and voted with a super majority vote by the CNCF TOC. The TOC can also shut down a working group with a super majority vote.

## Process

If you would like to submit a working group proposal, please submit a pull request to the working groups folder. As an example, you can see the other working group proposals here: https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/master/workinggroups

You will also have to present to the CNCF TOC and wider community before your WG proposal will be voted upon by the TOC and community. You can request a presentation by filing an issue here: https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues

At a minimum, please include this information:

* Goals
* Non-goals
* Mailing list information
* The location of meetings / agenda / notes
* Initial interested parties to show that there are multiple people across multiple orgs interested
* The chair(s) and TOC sponsor being explicitly listed so they are discoverable
